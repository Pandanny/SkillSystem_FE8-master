Units are divided into the
following three types:
    Player (blue)
    Enemy (red)
    Neutral (green)
Blue units are controlled by the
player. Red units are the enemy
units the player must defeat.
Red units will attack both blue
and green units, so be careful.
# 0x060E
Units take turns moving in
the following order:
    1. Player (blue)
    2. Enemy (red)
    3. Neutral (green)
# 0x060F
If a main character's Hit Points
are reduced to zero, the game
ends.
# 0x0610
The blue area that appears
when you select a unit is
its movement range. Place the
cursor on an enemy unit to see
its movement range.
# 0x0611
Mounted units can move again
after visiting homes or villages
if they have movement remaining.
This is most common among
cavaliers and pegasus knights.
# 0x0612
The red area that appears when
you select a unit is its
attack range. Place the cursor
on an enemy unit to see its
attack range.
# 0x0613
Each weapon type has its own
strengths and weaknesses.
Swords do well against axes.
Axes do well against lances.
Lances do well against swords.
This is called the
Weapon Triangle.
# 0x0614
Each type of magic has its own
strengths and weaknesses.
Light is strong against Dark.
Dark is strong against Anima.
Anima is strong against Light.
This is called the
Trinity of Magic.
# 0x0615
Some weapons are especially
effective against certain units.
These weapons will cause heavy
damage to those units. For
example, bows are particularly
effective against flying units.
The weapon icons in the combat
information window will glow
when your unit is facing an
enemy that is weak against
that weapon.
# 0x0616
Critical hits inflict three times
the normal damage to enemies.
Your chance of a critical strike
changes depending on your unit's
attributes and the weapon with
which you are attacking.
# 0x0617
Any attack from a weapon is a
physical attack. Each unit's
DEF (defense) attribute
shows how well he defends
against physical attacks. The
higher the number, the less
damage he takes. Knights and
mercenaries have good defense.
# 0x0618
Any attack with magic is called
a magical attack. Your unit's
RES (resistance) attribute
shows how well he defends
against them. The higher the
number, the less damage he
takes. Mages, monks, clerics
& shamans have high resistance.
# 0x0619
Restore HP to your units by using
vulneraries, elixirs, and staves.
Vulneraries and elixirs heal
only the user, while staves heal
only the units on whom they're
used. Choose your healing
items carefully in battle.
# 0x061A
There are five abnormal states
a unit can enter:
1. Sleep
(Asleep and unable to move)
2. Silence
(Unable to use magic or staves)
3. Poison
(Take continual damage)
4. Berserk
(Attack enemies and allies alike)
5. Petrify
(Turned to stone, cannot move)
These conditions will continue for
several turns. They can be
reversed with a Restore staff.
# 0x061B
Here is the information shown if
you choose the strategic
combat information window:

HP: Unit's remaining HP.
MT: Amount of damage the
equipped weapon inflicts.
HIT: Chance an attack will land.
CRIT: Chance the weapon will
land a critical blow.
# 0x061C
Here is the information shown if
you choose the detailed
combat information window:

HP: Unit's remaining HP.
ATK: Amount of damage your
attack will inflict.
DEF: Amount of damage enemy
attacks will be reduced by.
HIT: Chance an attack will land.
CRIT: Chance the weapon will land
a critical blow.
AS: The speed of each unit's
attack, which determines how
many attacks each unit makes.
# 0x061D
Any unit can rescue a blue or
green unit in an adjacent tile.
However, your constitution must
be higher than that of the unit
you're trying to rescue.
The rescuing unit suffers a
penalty in speed and skill,
but the rescued unit is
protected from attacks.
If a unit is about to lose all
of its HP, use the rescue
command to whisk it to safety.
# 0x061E
You can drop a rescued unit into
any adjacent tile. The dropped
unit will not be able to move
until the next turn.
# 0x061F
You can purchase items at
shops. You can also pick them
up by visiting villagers and
opening chests. Enemies
sometimes drop items when
they are defeated.
# 0x0620
Choose an item from the item
list and press the A Button
to use it. Items that cannot
be used by that unit will be
grayed out.
# 0x0621
You can trade items with units
in adjacent tiles. Select Trade
on the command menu, and then
select the unit with whom you
want to trade. Next, place the
cursor on the item you want to
take from the other unit's
inventory and press the A Button
to receive that item.
# 0x0622
Items have a limited number of
uses. Each time you use an item
its durability goes down. The
number next to an item indicates
how many times it can be used.
When that number reaches 0, the
item breaks and disappears.
Be careful not to let items drop
to 0 in the heat of battle.
# 0x0623
A supply convoy travels with
your main character. If you
move to a space adjacent your
supply convoy, you can trade
items with it. On the battle
preparation screen, you can
also buy and sell items at the
supply convoy. The convoy can
store up to 100 items for you.
# 0x0624
Move a unit onto an armory and
then choose Armory to buy
weapons. You can also sell
items you've collected here.
# 0x0625
Move a unit onto a shop and
then choose Shop to buy and
sell items, magic tomes, and
staves.
# 0x0626
Forests and mountains give
units additional cover. When
your units are in these tiles,
enemy hit percentages will be
reduced. When entering attack
range, try to stop in one of
these spaces.
# 0x0627
Any unit that ends its turn
on a fortress, castle gate,
gate, or throne will regain
some HP automatically at the
beginning of the next turn.
# 0x0628
Move a unit to a house to visit
the occupants of that house.
This is a good way of gaining
useful information that might
turn the battle in your favor.
Visit houses whenever you get
the opportunity.
# 0x0629
Move a unit to a village to
speak with its villagers.
You can gain information,
items, and even money from
villages, so visit them if
you have the opportunity.
# 0x062A
Move units onto spaces with
chests to open them. Chests
are filled with all sorts of
useful items. However, you'll
need a chest key or lockpicks
to open the chest.
# 0x062B
If you see an old snag near
a river, knock it over to
form an impromptu bridge.
# 0x062C
Attack cracked walls to
destroy them and create
new paths.
# 0x062D
Darkness and fog limit your
field of vision, preventing
you from seeing distant enemies.
Use thieves, torches, and
Torch staves to increase your
field of vision.
# 0x062E
These siege weapons
fire missiles from long
distances. Place an archer or
sniper on them to use them.
# 0x062F
On your quest, you will run
across many characters who
might join your cause. Watch
story hints carefully to find
who should talk to these
characters and convince them
to join you.
# 0x0630
Except in rare cases, if one of
your units loses all of its HP,
it will retreat from battle and be
unable to fight again. Be careful!
# 0x0631
Some units have special bonds
between them. The longer they
spend in adjoining spaces, the
stronger that bond will grow.
Once this bond is strong enough,
the Support command will appear
on the command menu.
Select it to make the characters
share a support conversation.
# 0x0632
If supportive units are within
three spaces of each other they
both gain special combat
bonuses. There are three levels
of support. The higher the level,
the better the bonuses received.
Support levels increase each
time units share a conversation.
# 0x0633
Green units are neutral. They
may become allies if you speak
to them. If you move to a space
adjacent to a green unit, the
Talk command may appear.
Choose Talk to convince the
unit to join you.
# 0x0634
Some enemy units will join you
if you talk to them. Move a
character you think might know
that enemy unit into a space
adjacent to it to see if they
can talk.
Be careful! Enemy units will
continue to attack until you
talk to them! Try not to take
them out or be taken out before
you have a chance to chat.
# 0x0635
If you defeat the enemy boss,
you clear the map. There is no
need to defeat all enemy units.
# 0x0636
Move the main character onto a
throne, castle gate, gate, or
other such location and choose
Seize from the command menu
to clear the map.
# 0x0637
Clear the map by wiping out
all enemy units.
# 0x0638
Hold out against the enemy for
a set number of turns to clear
the map.
# 0x0639
Choose Suspend on the command
menu to save your game during
a battle. The next time you
play, choose Resume to continue
playing where you left off.
# 0x063A
Choose Save from the world map
to save your game data between
chapters.
# 0x063B
Place the cursor on a space
and press the A Button to
move to that location.
# 0x063C
Some areas on the world map
contain stores. You can see
where stores are located by
placing the cursor on a location
and viewing the shop icons that
appear next to the place name.
You can enter any of these

Units gain EXP (experience
points) by fighting and by using
staves. They go up a level when
they earn 100 EXP. As they go
up in level, characters become
stronger, more skilled, etc.
The highest level is level 20.
# 0x0641
Most units can change classes
once they reach level 10.

improves a unit's abilities.

sure to change classes. When
changing classes, you will be able
to choose between 2 classes.

# 0x07D9
Silent Gilliam
# 0x07DA
Gilliam returned to his home of Frelia, where

knight. His imposing countenance was said to
strike fear in the hearts of even the most

# 0x07DB
Franz the Faithful
# 0x07DC
He continued to serve Renais with the same
devotion that he had during the War of the
Stones. His generous nature and easy smile

# 0x07DD
Moulder, Wise Counselor
# 0x07DE
After the War of the Stones, Moulder
continued to serve the royal family of

before him.

# 0x07E2

skill and hone both body and spirit.

# 0x07E5
Colm, Good-Natured Thief
# 0x07E6

in need from the shadows.
# 0x07E7
Garcia, the Warrior Reborn
# 0x07E8
He returned to Ide to help with its

valor, and experience inspired many.

Innes, King and Strategician
# 0x07EA

and tactical prowess helped him build a court
of loyal vassals that served to lead the
country to greater prosperity.
# 0x07EB
Lute, Prodigy
# 0x07EC

She grew into a great and well-traveled sage.
# 0x07ED
Natasha, Sacred Healer
# 0x07EE

Grado to help rebuild the empire. She dedicated
herself to easing the grief of those families
that lost soldiers during the war.
# 0x07EF
Cormag, Aloof Lanceman
# 0x07F0
Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the

after, he left to wander on his own. When
he reappeared, he rejoined the army not as
a knight but as a common soldier.
# 0x07F1
Ephraim, Restoration King
# 0x07F2
Busy days awaited him upon his return to
Renais. He oversaw the rebuilding not only
of his own country but also of the entire
continent of Magvel. His work was difficult,
but his success made him a legend.
# 0x07F3
Forde, the Wild Knight
# 0x07F4
Upon Forde's return to Renais, his secret
hobby of painting was discovered. He was
commissioned as a court artist. His work
grew popular, and his days became so busy
that he often regretted his career change.
# 0x07F5
Kyle, Ardent Knight
# 0x07F6
His service to the royal family of Renais
continued without change. He became a
battalion commander and gained much trust
and responsibility for training new recruits.
# 0x07F7
Amelia, Rose of the War
# 0x07F8
Following the war, she returned to Grado
to assist in her country's reconstruction.
She surrounded herself with new friends and
used the strength she found on the battlefield
to live her life in happiness.
# 0x07F9
Artur, Saint of Light
# 0x07FA
Artur moved to Renais to help rebuild the
shattered country. He worked without rest to
ease the pain and grief of those who suffered
during the war. His self-sacrifice made him
into a folk hero among the peasantry.
# 0x07FB
Gerik, the Desert Tiger
# 0x07FC
Gerik continued as a mercenary. Over the
years, his reputation grew so great that he
had more job offers than he could handle. One
day, without warning, he left, never to return.
# 0x07FD
Tethys, Beloved Dancer
# 0x07FE
She danced from city to city, and the
entire continent became her stage.
Her fame grew and grew, and large crowds
gathered wherever she performed.
# 0x07FF
Marisa, the Crimson Flash
# 0x0800
Marisa became battalion leader for an
elite mercenary force. Many men sought
to challenge her to a duel, and none
of them stood up to her blade.
# 0x0801
Saleh, the Well of Wisdom
# 0x0802
Saleh returned to Caer Pelyn, where he
remained a faithful servant of the Manakete.
His days were not spent in isolation, though.
Many of the friends he met during the War of
the Stones came to visit his village.
# 0x0803
Ewan, Enthusiastic Student
# 0x0804
Ewan continued his studies, modeling
his life after the teachings of Saleh.
Eventually, his education branched off into
different paths. His insatiable curiosity
led him on a trip to explore the world.
# 0x0805
L'Arachel, Queen of Light
# 0x0806
She succeeded her uncle as ruler of the
Rausten Theocracy several years after
the war ended. She never lost her...unique
perspective on life. She spent much of her
rule visiting the neighboring countries.
# 0x0807
Dozla of the Steady Axe
# 0x0808
As L'Arachel rose to become queen, he
remained by her side. Watching L'Arachel
grow to become the queen she was destined to
be was Dozla's greatest joy in life.
# 0x0809
Rennac, Rich Merchant
# 0x080A
L'Arachel summoned Rennac back to Rausten,
and he was forced to return. He was never
able to escape his service to the self-
centered princess who became queen.
Admittedly, he didn't try very hard.
# 0x080B
Duessel, Obsidian General
# 0x080C
Following the war, Duessel returned to Grado,
where he was instrumental in its rebuilding.
He spent his remaining years watching over
Grado and sharing his wisdom with other
nations as an expert combat instructor.
# 0x080D
Myrrh, the Great Dragon
# 0x080E

a long and full life, served by the people
of Caer Pelyn and comforted by the memories
of her dear friends.
# 0x080F
Knoll, Watcher of Darkness
# 0x0810
Knoll returned to Grado, where he dedicated
himself to rebuilding it and fulfilling
Lyon's vision. When the country was restored
to its former glory, he disappeared without
a trace, never to be seen again.
# 0x0811
Joshua, the Tempest King
# 0x0812
Joshua returned to Jehanna and ruled over
it as king. His skills as a leader had
grown great, and Jehanna flourished as
never before. He never outgrew his love
of travel and games of chance.
# 0x0813
Graceful Syrene
# 0x0814
Syrene continued as commander of Frelia's
pegasus knights. Her grace and beauty in
flight were the subject of many songs
and paintings, and her popularity soared.
# 0x0815
Tana, Winged Queen
# 0x0816
Tana lived happily in the prosperous post-
war Frelia. She flew to Renais often to
visit her dear friend Eirika.
# 0x0817
Busy days awaited Eirika and Ephraim as they
struggled to rebuild Renais. Their work gave
new hope to those ravaged by the war, and
with Eirika's constant help, Ephraim grew to
be a trusted and honorable king.
# 0x0818
Upon their return to Renais, Eirika and Seth
were wed, with the blessings of Ephraim and all
of the Knights of Renais. The tale of the love
that grew between a princess and her loyal
knight became a beloved romance in Renais.
# 0x0819
After the war, Eirika and Saleh returned to their
respective homes. Eirika visited Caer Pelyn
when she could. Eventually, she left Renais in
the care of her brother and wed Saleh. Their
daughter resembles the legendary Nada Kuya.
# 0x081A
Following the war, Tana and Eirika remained
the best of friends. They visited one another
when time permitted, and as they grew older,
their children shared a bond of friendship
as close as Eirika and Tana themselves did.
# 0x081B
After the war, Eirika and Forde returned to
Renais. Eirika spent her days toiling in
the reconstruction of Renais, and he was her
faithful supporter. His portrait of Eirika
captured the smile he had thought lost forever.
# 0x081C
After the war, Ephraim returned to Renais and
Myrrh to Darkling Woods. They both turned their
attention to their respective duties but never
forgot one another. Though Myrrh never again
left Darkling Woods, Ephraim often visited her.
# 0x081D
Ephraim and L'Arachel each returned home
after the war, but L'Arachel visited Renais
often. Over time, the two were wed. Their
marriage threw Rausten into turmoil, but
L'Arachel's self-centeredness carried the day.
# 0x081E
Once Renais was stable again, Ephraim and
Tana were wed. Innes protested vocally, but
when he saw how happy Tana was, he gave the
marriage his blessings. Renais and Frelia
are now bound by blood as well as friendship.
# 0x081F
Natasha returned to Renais with Seth, where
the two were wed. The reconstruction of Renais
kept them busy, but when all the work was
done, they settled down to live their days
in peace and happiness.
# 0x0820
Franz brought Amelia home with him to Renais.

but once she and Franz were married, she
retired her commission. The two had a daughter
who grew to be a great knight herself.
# 0x0821
Gilliam and Syrene returned to Frelia, where they
were married. All agreed they were a perfect
match, and their union was blessed by the
crown and the order of knights. The two
continued their unwavering service together.
# 0x0822
At Innes's request, Vanessa moved into
Castle Frelia where she continued her duties
as a knight of the realm. Thereafter, they
had a child and lived happily with the
blessing of all around them.
# 0x0823
Forde's love for Vanessa grew after the war,
and although she loved him as well, she
placed her duty to Frelia first. Undeterred,
Forde moved to Frelia himself. Over time,
the two were wed.
# 0x0824
Father and son returned to Ide, where they
toiled together to rebuild their village.
Ross grew to become a greater warrior than
even his father. When he himself had a son,
that child continued his family's legacy.
# 0x0825
The childhood friends became lovers first,
then husband and wife. Worried for Neimi's
well-being, Colm gave up his adventurer's ways.
Neimi passed on her grandfather's skill in
archery to her own son and daughter.
# 0x0826
Artur and Lute were married upon their return.
Artur handled the housework, but otherwise,
their lives were unchanged. When they had a
son, Lute's interests shifted from studying
Artur to studying her son's baffling habits.
# 0x0827
After the war, Kyle and Lute were married in
Renais. Kyle's friends were disturbed by his
choice of brides, but they could not deny
his happiness. Before long, they had a son,
and Kyle dedicated himself to his upbringing.
# 0x0828
When Joshua returned to Jehanna, he took
Natasha as his bride and claimed the throne
as its rightful heir. Natasha was the perfect
companion, and together, they carried the
mighty desert nation to great glory.
# 0x0829
Sometimes, the greatest friends also differ
greatly in personality. When Kyle and Forde
returned home, they were celebrated in song
and story. They lived their days in happiness,
as dearest friends and toughest rivals.
# 0x082A
Cormag returned to Grado to assist in the
reconstruction of his country. Shortly
after, he left to wander on his own. Tana
spent years looking for him. In time, she
found him and knighted him in Frelia's service.
# 0x082B
Stories tell of the sparks that flew between
L'Arachel and Innes when they first met. As
the love between them flourished, so too did
the bond that united their two nations.
# 0x082C
Gerik and Tethys remained bound to no nation
and beholden to no authority. They bought
themselves a leisurely retirement. Gerik
taught fencing to city youths, and Tethys
found many stages on which to dance.
# 0x082D
Gerik remained a mercenary, and Marisa
became his company's fencing instructor.
Gerik returned the affection she gave
him, although he was troubled to learn she
was clumsy at everything but fighting.
# 0x082E
Myrrh returned to Darkling Woods, but at
Saleh's request, she eventually moved to Caer
Pelyn. In time, the townsfolk learned to
treat her not as the Great Dragon but
rather as a normal girl, and she was happy.
# 0x082F
Master and student returned to Caer Pelyn to
study in peace. Ewan worked hard, and in time,
his power grew to rival Saleh's. As equals,
the two continued their studies together and
expanded their knowledge ever more.
# 0x0830
Joshua returned to Jehanna with Marisa, where
she pledged service to the crown and became
the top swordfighter in the land. Joshua still
loved games of chance, but when it came to
Marisa, she was ever the winner.
# 0x0831
L'Arachel was, in time, made queen of Rausten,
with Dozla at her side, as always. Later, Dozla
wept like a baby when L'Arachel was wed. His
emotional outburst is remembered as much as,
if not more than, the ceremony itself.
# 0x0832
Amelia traveled to Ross's hometown, where she
decided to remain. Over time, the two fell in
love and were wed. Years later they had a son
who grew into a warrior. As he grew in skill
and strength, he surpassed even his father.
# 0x0833
After the war, Ewan and Amelia set out, as
promised, on a trip around the world. Their
deeds along the way made small legends in the
regions they visited. In time, Amelia gave
birth to a daughter, and they settled down.
# 0x0834
After the war, Joshua challenged Gerik to a
duel in hopes of pressing him to move to
Jehanna. The match ended in a tie, but Gerik
was impressed by Joshua's swagger. From that
day forward, Gerik never left Joshua's side.
# 0x0835
Sisters Syrene and Vanessa returned to Frelia
after the war for a long-overdue talk. They
talked of love and war, of friends now gone.
Together, they renewed their bond as siblings
and vowed never to let that bond fail.
# 0x0836
After the reconstruction of Renais, Innes
challenged Ephraim to a duel. The match
ended in a tie. After the fight, Eirika
acknowledged her love for Innes, and the
two were wed with Ephraim's blessings.
# 0x0837
After the war, Kyle visited Frelia, where
he was greeted with a warm reception by
Syrene. After the two retired, they were
wed. They raised a daughter whose skill
in martial arts and etiquette excelled.
# 0x0838
Upon their return to Grado, Duessel reunited
Amelia with her mother. The two wept with
joy, giving thanks to Duessel. Afterward, Amelia
became the most trusted companion of the
man once known as Obsidian.

The continent of Yaska.@0003
A human land that has developed
sophisticated societies over the course@0003
of the centuries@0003
As regional variances in human behavior arose,
so did nations and their governments.@0003
To the northeast, is the Theocracy of Orebro,
a frozen tundra with pious believers.@0003
On the west coast is the Kingdom of Mostyn,@0003
known for their gallant cavaliers and 
carefree lifestyles.@0003
To the south is the Kingdom of Freyung,@0003 
a mountainous country 
with few natural resources.@0003
Wedged in between is Kuching,@0003
whose people choose to live as their
ancestors did as nomads on the vast plains.@0003 
In the southeast is the Kingdom of Mahala@0003
a tropical land with scorching sands
and pleasant oases. @0003
In the middle of it all is the Empire of Nevan.@0003
Nevan is the largest and greatest empire
on the continent.@0003
It's capitol is impregnable, built within a great
mountain range that few dare to cross.@0003
The interior of the mountain is 
full of rare minerals@0003
that are mined and sold.@0003
The people there live lavish lives, 
well protected by not only
the mountain range,@0003
but the fearsome dracoknights
that guard the capitol.@0003
Outside the capitol and the interior, 
rural Nevan is adorned with@0003
farming villages@0003
that serve to grow food for the nation and
act as a rest stop for traders en route@0003
to other cities to sell their wares..@0003
While the capitol is ruled by the Emperor, 
he has many lords that oversee
States, or regional provinces of his@0003
nation to ensure peace.@0003
Given the wide land that the 
Emperor oversees,@0003
his eye does not catch all misdeeds.@0003 
In Nevan in the state of Belaro,
the people live under strict rule of Lord Gradin,@0003
who heavily taxes the people in order to afford 
his luxurious lifestyle.@0003 
In times of poverty, banditry is on the rise.
Now some men and women who would@0003
otherwise lead simple lives,
find themselves performing unscrupulous acts...@0003

@0080@0004Eirika is grateful for the king's aid.@0003
@0080@0004Chasing rumors of her brother, she sets out 
for Grado.@0003@0002
@0080@0004The group's first stop is the remote village

Eirika and company pursue the thief who

She leads her group in search of the

With her bracelet recovered, Eirika sets
out with renewed determination.@0003
@0080@0004Passing through the ancient forest Za'ha 
brings them close to Grado's border.@0003
As they near the town of Serafew, Eirika's
fears are assuaged by the lack of troops.@0003
@0080@0004But never-before-seen terrors crawl in the 
shadows of the trees.@0003
@0080@0004

An ominous wave of dark creatures washes 
over the continent...@0003
@0080@0004Eirika's journey to find her brother, Ephraim, 
grows ever more perilous.@0003
Still, she presses on despite the danger. 
Her will is strong.@0003@0002
@0080@0004The town of Serafew, located on the border 
of Renais and Grado.@0003
@0080@0004The people of both countries have long used 
the town as a meeting place.@0003
It stands as testimony to the friendship the 
two nations have shared these many years.@0003
Now, however, Serafew is teeming with 
Grado troops.@0003
@0080@0004
# 0x08E3
Eirika suppresses her feelings of unease 
and continues to search for her brother.@0003
@0080@0004Passing through Serafew, the group crosses 
into the Grado Empire.@0003@0002
From here forward, there is no doubt that
they are walking through hostile territory.@0003
@0080@0004In hopes of avoiding unnecessary trouble,@0003
Eirika and company head for a sparsely
populated region of Grado.@0003
@0080@0004However, it is too late. Their movements are 
already being tracked.@0003
@0080@0004
# 0x08E4
Rumors say that Ephraim has been defeated 
and taken prisoner.@0003
Now Eirika must find a way to rescue her 
brother from beneath enemy eyes.@0003
@0080@0004Eirika's company rushes toward Castle 
Renvall, where Ephraim is being held.@0003
@0080@0004Surrounded by lakes, Renvall is a natural
fortress, all but unassailable.@0003

A lone bridge, held by the enemy, is its
only entrance.@0003@0002
Eirika has only one choice.@0003
@0080@0004Eirika decides to confront Grado's soldiers 
head on...@0003

# 0x08E5
The @0080@0021Tower of Valni@0080@0021 has appeared to the
east of Castle Frelia on the world map.@0003
Once held by Grado's troops, it has become
home to a host of @0080@0021dark creatures@0080@0021.@0003
Battling these monstrosities is a good 
way for units to gain strength.@0003
Try using the tower as a training area 
to gain extra experience.@0003@0002
Be aware: you cannot save your battle 
preparations for tower skirmishes.@0003
Once you clear a tower map, you'll have 
access to the next floor.@0003
Each floor is more difficult than the last, 
so come prepared!@0003@0002
Dark creatures also may appear on other

To engage these demons in combat,@0003

@0080@0004Her search for a ship leads her to Port Kiris 
in Carcino.@0003
@0080@0004Carcino is a young nation ruled by a council

knife-edged peaks.@0003

@0080@0004However, Innes and his troop meet the

@0080@0004Against all odds, Innes halts the invasion, 
keeping Frelia's border intact.@0003
@0080@0004Ephraim coordinates Frelia's troops in an

@0080@0004Unbeknownst to Ephraim, Grado forces are 
waiting for them at Fort Rigwald.@0003

They've fortified their positions and plan

A former lance instructor to Ephraim,@0003
Grado's General Duessel often came to Renais 
as an emissary of his empire.@0003
@0080@0004Despite their stations, the two men share 
similar dispositions and a warm relationship.@0003
@0080@0004Why has Grado started this war?@0003
What is the miasma of evil emanating 
from the country?@0003

Ephraim believes that Duessel can answer
these questions.@0003
@0080@0004It is this belief that propels Ephraim
forward into Grado territory.@0003

General Duessel tells them of the enigmatic 
Dark Stone.@0003

The product of Grado's research into 
the dark arts, @0003

the Dark Stone possesses power far beyond 
that of the Sacred Stones.@0003
@0080@0004According to the rumors swirling about, @0003

Vigarde's descent into madness coincides 
with the creation of the Dark Stone.@0003
@0080@0004Ephraim must confirm the existence of

Ephraim leads the group to Za'albul Marsh in 
search of the missing Myrrh.@0003

They learn from soldiers and villagers that 
Myrrh had been captured by General Selena, @0003

one of Grado's commanders.
She was last seen heading east.@0003

To regain their companion, the group will 
now be forced to fight.@0003
@0080@0004Ephraim steels his heart to the reality
that he must face Selena.@0003
@0080@0004

Myrrh returns safely to Ephraim's side.@0003
@0080@0004A noble warrior to the end, Selena fought
with great honor, @0003

never once using Myrrh as a hostage.@0003
@0080@0004Ephraim renews his vow to pierce the veil 
of mystery surrounding the Grado Empire.@0003

@0080@0004Though Eirika and her troop have left the 
Hall, Grado's forces pursue them relentlessly.@0003

Trapped in the burning desert, enemy forces
close in on them from all sides. @0003
@0080@0004With no time to wait for Frelia's troops, 
Ephraim leaves for Jehanna immediately.@0003

@0080@0004Orson, a former Knight of Renais, had been 
assigned to guard Castle Renais.@0003

The Sacred Stones that defeated the Demon
King radiate a constant and dazzling light.@0003
@0080@0004The Sacred Stones are the only power against
the dark, the last hope of humanity. @0003
@0080@0004It is only natural that evil would seek

According to legend, the Sacred Stones 
have sealed evil away from the world.@0003
Four of the five stones have been destroyed,

@0080@0004Ephraim and company challenge the demons of

@0080@0004According to legend,@0003

the original possessors of the Sacred Stones
defeated the Demon King in Darkling Woods.@0003

His foul blood seeped into the land,
corrupting every seed and every root.@0003

The once-pristine forest was transformed by
the flood of disease and venom.@0003

Legend says the Demon King's corpse lies 
there still, not dead but dreaming.@0003

Dreaming of when the last stone is crushed,@0003

worms and return to the surface.@0003

Ah, we've had no time!@0003@0009Milady, we lack the arms to defend this

Eirika is my friend, and she needs

army has already reached Frelia.@0003
Princess, this place is perilous.@0003
We should bypass Mulan altogether

You were there when Renais was
invaded@0016... @0016You saw what I saw.@0003
You saw how the people suffered 
at the hands of Grado's soldiers.@0003
Homes were destroyed, possessions
stolen, women kidnapped@0016...@0016@0003
Anyone who resisted was executed
without question, without hesitation.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003@000CPlease, Seth. I can't allow that
to happen here.@0003
I don't want to see any more people
harmed by Grado's atrocities.@0003@0009All right, Princess. I understand.
Perhaps we can retake Mulan.@0003
But, Princess, you must act with
caution. Your people need you, too.@0003@000COf course, Seth.

Grado army's taken over the castle.@0003
It looks like they've seized the
castle gate, too.@0003
Smart work@0016--@0016the gate provides defense
and heals wounds to boot.@0003
They must be fierce warriors to have
taken the gate. Watch yourself.@0003

@0009@0010@015C@000C@0010@FFFF@0009That knight encamped at the castle was
wearing the finest armor I've seen.@0003

When I was a recruit, the soldiers

strength to Renais once again?@0003@000C@0016...@0016I'm sorry. I'm retired now.@0003
I'm not a soldier anymore. It's@0016...@0016

life fighting for my country's honor.@0003
I left no time for my family.@0003
I spent my life fighting for faceless,
uncaring nobles.@0003@0002
When my wife fell ill and died, I met
the child she had left behind@0016...@0016@0003
At that moment, I finally realized
what my duty had cost me.@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003@000CI stood at my wife's grave and promised
her I would be a father to our son.@0003

gave this to me.@0003@000CIt's a wonderful gift.@0003
But you should be careful, wearing
such a valuable item so openly.@0003
Since Renais was invaded, things have
become so dangerous around here.@0003
There are gold-hungry thieves and
bandits everywhere.@0003@0002
The most wicked are Bazba's Bandits.
They are@0016...@0016cruel beyond words.@0003
If you have something they want, your
life is worth less than nothing.@0003
Just the other day they assaulted some
travelers and@0016... @0016Oh, it was awful.@0003@0009I@0016...@0016I can't believe such things@0016...@0016@0003@000COh, Renais is finished, mark my words.
The Grado Empire's stolen our future.@0003
Our only hope against them was that
Prince Ephraim would prevail, but@0016...@0016@0003
Rumor has it that he's on the verge of
being crushed by Grado's vast numbers.@0003

Let's begin.@0003@0009Tell me, though: why do you want

I thought you didn't care for
violence@0016...@0016@0003@000CI do not like uncivilized behavior.@0003

And yet@0016...@0016@0003@0009And yet what?@0003@000CI've always relied on you to
protect me, Brother.@0003
I would rather not be such a
burden to you in the future.@0003
So, I thought maybe I should
learn to protect myself@0016...@0016@0003@0009I'm your brother. Brothers are
supposed to protect their sisters.@0003
It's nothing for you to worry about.
It's no cause for concern.@0003@000CYes, but@0016...@0016@0003
I am your sister. Sisters are supposed
to worry about their brothers.@0003@0002
So I would like to learn something of
swordplay, if only a little.@0003
And maybe, someday, I can protect you
in your time of need@0016...@0016@0003
So please, Ephraim.@0003@0009All right, all right. How could I say no?@0003
Honestly, once you get an idea into your
head, that's it. I might as well give in.@0003@0002
It's agreed. I'll teach you, but won't
hold back because you're my sister.@0003
And I want no complaining once we've
started, Eirika.@0003@000CComplain? Me? Never!@0003

abhors violence.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000AAnd have you noticed the recent
promotions? Who are they going to?@0003
Certainly not to the soldiers who
have Grado's best interests at heart.@0003
I fear this invasion is the prelude
to a much larger war.@0003
I feel as though His Majesty is no
longer the man we knew him to be.@0003@000CGlen, it doesn't matter what any
of us might think of our orders.@0003
We are his servants, and we will not
question His Majesty's intentions.@0003@000AI know that, Selena.
And yet@0016...@0016@0003@0008That's enough. Both of you.
His Majesty summons us.@0003
Let's hope we can learn a
little during our audience.@0003

@0009@0010@0140@0009@0016...@0016I appreciate your work in
fulfilling your previous orders.@0003
You are the hammers that drive
the nails of the empire's will@0016...@0016@0003
You will continue to operate
@0016...@0016without hesitation@0016...@0016@0003
wherever I send you.@0003@000C@0010@0125@000CBy your command.@0003@000C@0011@000C@0010@013F@000CIn Your Majesty's name.@0003@000C@0011@000C@0010@014B@000CYes, sire@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0016...@0016However, I know this@0016...@0016@0003
You, my Imperial Three, lack the strength
to conquer the remaining nations alone.@0003
In the invasion of Renais, certain
soldiers performed beyond expectation.@0003
I have chosen them to join you as
new generals in the empire's service.@0003
@0016...@0016Come.@0003
# 0x0999
@0009@0010@0140@0009@0016...@0016The performance of these
men surpassed even your own.@0003
With the addition of these three@0016...@0016@0003
The empire will have six generals
strong enough to conquer this land.@0003
Do you understand?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0148@000C@0017Heh heh heh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I am Riev, given the name
Blood Beryl by His Majesty.@0003
I know I am a newcomer, but
I pray for your favor.@0003@0009@0010@0125@0009@0016...@0016Understood.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@000C@0010@0143@000CI'm Caellach. I was a mercenary,
fighting in the desert.@0003
Seems I'm to be called
Tiger Eye@0016...@0016@0003
You're a fine-lookin' lass, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm gonna love working with you.@0003@0017@0017@0009@0010@013F@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0011@000C@0011@000C@0010@0142@000CSo we meet again. You know me as General
Valter, but you will call me the Moonstone.@0003
I'll save you worthless dogs from your
own incompetence. You'll thank me later.@0003@000E@0010@014B@000E@0080@000A@0008Valter@0016... @0016You scum!@0003@000A@0010@0125@000APeace, Glen.@0003@000A@0011@0008@0011@000C@0011@0009@0010@0140@0009Selena. Caellach. You will

the defense of the empire.@0003

still eludes us@0016...@0016@0003
Her brother, Prince Ephraim, leads
a resistance within our borders.@0003
Bring the siblings to me.@0003@000BHa ha@0016... @0016Of course.@0003@0009@0011@000D@0016......@0016@0003

@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@010C@0009C-Colm@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CNeimi?!
What are you doing here?@0003
I told you to wait for me,
didn't I?@0003@0009I couldn't@0016... @0016It's too dangerous.@0003
C'mon, let's go home.@0003@000C@0017We don't have a home! Don't you get it? 
Look, just leave everything to me.@0003
I can take care of it in a flash, but I don't
need a clumsy oaf like you tagging along.@0003@0017@0009But@0016...@0016but@0016...@0016@0003@000COh, this is ridiculous.@0003
We'll talk later. Don't
leave my side, Neimi.@0003@0009I@0016-- @0016All right.@0003
# 0x099B
@0080@0021Walls@0080@0021 with cracks in them can be
attacked and destroyed.@0003
Once a wall is destroyed, you can pass
through the opening you've created.@0003
When your way seems blocked, be sure
to check all the @0080@0021walls@0080@0021.@0003
# 0x099C
The bandits' @0080@0021hand axes@0080@0021 can be used
in both @0080@0021direct@0080@0021 and @0080@0021indirect combat@0080@0021.@0003
They can be wielded like normal axes
in direct, hand-to-hand combat@0003
or thrown to strike enemies who are
a space away or at an angle to you.@0003
Like bows, they can also hit enemies
on the @0080@0021other sides of walls@0080@0021.@0003
# 0x099D
The @0080@0021thief@0080@0021 Colm has appeared.@0003
Thieves can @0080@0021steal@0080@0021 items from
other units.@0003
Also, they can @0080@0021open the locks@0080@0021 of
@0080@0021doors@0080@0021 and @0080@0021chests@0080@0021. Thieves
are handy allies to have around.@0003
# 0x099E
Place the cursor on a unit and press
the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021 to display that
unit's @0080@0021status@0080@0021.@0003
For example, if you select a bandit
and press the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021, you'll
see that he's carrying a hand axe.@0003@0002
If you press the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021 again,
you'll see @0080@0021help information@0080@0021 for each
item on-screen.@0003
You can use the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021 to see
the properties of weapons and items.@0003
If there's something you don't 
understand about @0080@0021unit information@0080@0021, 
press the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021.@0003
# 0x099F
Bows are @0080@0021ranged weapons@0080@0021.
They can be used to attack enemies
who are a space away.@0003
Additionally, they can be used
to attack over walls.@0003
# 0x09A0
Colm and Neimi are childhood friends.
Try moving Neimi next to Colm and
have her @0080@0021talk@0080@0021 to him. He
may decide to join you.@0003
# 0x09A1
Colm and Neimi have an @0080@0021invisible
bond@0080@0021 that ties them together.@0003
Units that have such a bond can
develop a @0080@0021support relationship@0080@0021.@0003@0002
Units become closer and their bond
stronger the longer they are
@0080@0021adjacent to one another@0080@0021.@0003
Eventually, they will be able to
share a @0080@0021support conversation@0080@0021.@0003@0002
Units that share a support relationship
fight with @0080@0021improved abilities@0080@0021
when they are near each other.@0003@0002
There are three levels of support
units can share: @0080@0021C, B, and A@0080@0021.@0003
Levels are gained by staying
side-by-side as much as possible.@0003@0002
Colm and Neimi are not the only units
that can have support relationships.
Eirika and Seth, among others, can 
grow close to other units as well.@0003@0002
Watch how characters interact with each
other to guess at who might share
a support relationship with whom.@0003@0002
If you have two units you think may
have such a bond, @0080@0021place them next
to one another again and again@0080@0021.@0003
Who knows: they may eventually share
a @0080@0021support conversation@0080@0021.@0003@0002
However, bear in mind that each unit
can have only @0080@00215@0080@0021 support relationships.@0003
# 0x09A2
Enemy units may sometimes drop items
when they are defeated.@0003
In the same way you searched for hand
axes earlier, try looking at enemy items
with the @0080@0021R Button@0080@0021.@0003
@0080@0021Green items@0080@0021 are items that will be 
dropped. Check enemy items beforehand 
to gain the advantage in combat.@0003
# 0x09A3
@000C@0010@0104@0009@0010@0102@000CWe're approaching Serafew, at the
border of Renais and Grado.@0003
Once we cross, we'll be in Grado@0016...@0016@0005
Renvall won't be much farther.@0003@0009That is, assuming we can cross the
border without mishap@0016...@0016@0003
Oh!
Look! Over there!@0003
# 0x09A4
@000C@0010@0104@0009@0010@0102@0009Those strange figures@0016...@0016@0005
What@0016... @0016What are they?@0003
Are they@0016...@0016human?@0003@000CI've never seen anything like
it. What could they be?@0003
# 0x09A5
@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@011A@000CWhat have we done to deserve the trials
before us? What is happening to us?@0003
How could such abominations walk our lands
while the Sacred Stones protect us?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CLute, please, it's dangerous outside
the walls. Stay here in the village.@0003@0009Those are revenants, aren't they?@0003
They were the vanguard of the Demon
King in the days of darkness.@0003
The Tome of Nazania describes them in
chapter 2, section 7, paragraph 8.@0003@000CYou know of them?@0003@0009@0017Duh! I'm a prodigy. I can recall
most everything I see or hear.@0003
According to the book, revenants
attack using razor-sharp claws.@0003
Sounds painful, wouldn't you say?@0003@0017@000CYes, er, well@0016... @0016Be that as it may, I
must go aid those travelers outside.@0003
You should stay here within the
safety of the village.@0003@0009Very well. I don't mind staying here.
In fact, it seems the smarter choice.@0003@0015@000C@0011@0009Magic is far more powerful than any
monster's claws.@0003
The thickest hide and strongest armor
are useless against magic's power.@0003
Yes, I suppose I could have studied
swords, but only magic is worthy of me.@0003
Even if this village were to be assaulted
by monsters, I could defend it perfectly.@0003
# 0x09A6
@000A@0010@0102@000C@0010@011A@000CTravelers, you must listen to me! The
ancient forest of Za'ha is dangerous.@0003
Head south and pass through this place
before the fiends surround you!@0003@000AWho are you?@0003@000CMy name is Artur.@0003
The temple has assigned me the task of
cleansing the forest of these@0016...@0016things.@0003
There are so many of the fiends, though.
I wonder if I stand much chance alone.@0003
So if you would, please flee now while
you have the chance.@0003@000AFiends?@0003
You're not talking about the same fiends
that served the ancient Demon King?@0003
That can't be right@0016... @0016They're nothing
but legends and fairy tales@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes, I felt the same when I heard.@0003
And yet here they are. This place
is filled with them.@0003
I wonder how far they've spread@0016...@0016
Surely they're not in Renais alone.@0003@000ABut@0016...@0016why are they here? How?@0003@0008@0010@0104@0008Beware, Your Highness!
Something approaches!@0003
# 0x09A7
@0009@0010@011A@0009Please allow me to deal with this.@0003@0015@0009Evil shade! May the blessed light
drive you from this land!@0003
# 0x09A8
@0009@0010@0104@0009We ought to help. He can't fight
them all alone. Do you have orders?@0003
# 0x09A9
@0009@0010@011A@0009One of my companions is in that village
to the south.@0003
If any of you can get there swiftly,
I implore you to watch over her safety.@0003
# 0x09AA
@0009@0010@011A@0009Listen to me, travelers! If you
can, try to stay in the woods.@0003
# 0x09AB
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0104@0009Why should we stay in the woods?@0003@000CIn combat, the trees provide
cover against attacks.@0003
The trees and branches make it
difficult for enemies to strike.@0003@0009Is that so? Fair enough.@0003
Let's stick to trees then.@0003

I, L'Arachel, bestow upon you the honor

I am@0016...@0016a tad disappointed however.@0003
After all, I did rush all the way here

innit, Lady L'Arachel?!@0003@000D@0011@000D@0010@0124@000DWhat's shameful is the way you

mustn't continue!@0003
You cannot reveal your
true identity here!@0003@000BOh, yes, you're right. Oh, I get
so careless sometimes!@0003

@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015B@000CDo you see that old snag to the
south of here?@0003
Bet it would make a handy bridge
if you could knock it over.@0003
Take a weapon to it and give it a
few good whacks. That should do it.@0003
Here, take this and give it a try.
It ought to do the trick.@0003
# 0x09B6
There are three different schools of
@0080@0021magic@0080@0021, each of which is governed
by the @0080@0021trinity of magic@0080@0021.@0003
@0080@0021Light@0080@0021 is strong against @0080@0021Dark@0080@0021.
@0080@0021Dark@0080@0021 is strong against @0080@0021Anima@0080@0021.
@0080@0021Anima@0080@0021 is strong against @0080@0021Light@0080@0021.@0003
For now, just remember that @0080@0021Light
is strong against Dark@0080@0021.@0003
# 0x09B7
The @0080@0021magic@0080@0021 that Artur and Lute
wield cannot be stopped by
physical @0080@0021defense@0080@0021.@0003
However, magic @0080@0021resistance@0080@0021 can affect
the damage it does.@0003
So, it's possible to do high damage to
units like @0080@0021knights@0080@0021, who possess
strong @0080@0021defenses@0080@0021.@0003
On the other hand, it's difficult to harm
units with high @0080@0021resistance@0080@0021, like
pegasus knights.@0003
Magic can also be used to attack
directly or indirectly, like a hand axe.@0003
It can be wielded like a sword to strike
adjacent foes or like a bow to hit
enemies at a distance.@0003
# 0x09B8
Starting on this map, you'll be able
to use the @0080@0021preparations screen@0080@0021.@0003
You can @0080@0021choose which units@0080@0021 to send into
battle and @0080@0021manage items@0080@0021 to secure
the best chance of victory.@0003
# 0x09B9
Forests and other map areas may
offer @0080@0021terrain bonuses@0080@0021.@0003
Units in forests are harder to hit
and take less damage when struck.@0003
Simply put, staying under trees makes
it more difficult for enemies to hit 
and harm you.@0003
Areas that have @0080@0021terrain bonuses@0080@0021 are
@0080@0021forests@0080@0021, @0080@0021mountains@0080@0021, @0080@0021fortresses@0080@0021, and
@0080@0021gates@0080@0021, to name a few.@0003
Use terrain to your advantage during
combat to avoid risking your units.@0003
# 0x09BA
@0017@0009@0010@012A@0009Well, well. There's an arena in this town.@0003
Perfect. My pocket's feeling a bit light.@0003@0015@0009Say, is that a cleric? It is!

to startle you.@0003
May I offer my apologies@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CNo, it's not necessary@0016...@0016
It was my fault.@0003
Excuse me, I must be going@0016...@0016
Good day to you.@0003@000C@0011@0017@0009@0016...@0016And there she goes.@0003
Not my lucky day@0016...@0016

Guard. How fare you?@0003
I bring orders from His Majesty.@0003
Rumor has it that Princess Eirika of
Renais is making her way to Grado.@0003
You are to find her and to place
her in custody immediately.@0003@0009Yes, sir!@0003@000COne more thing@0016...@0016@0003
A traitor to the empire has fled
Castle Grado.@0003
We've received reports she is hiding
somewhere here in Serafew.@0003
I don't care if you have to tear this
town apart. Find the turncoat.@0003@0009Yes, sir, General Glen!@0003
If she resists, do we have
permission to execute her?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Yes. Permission granted.@0003@0009Understood! Grado's will be done.@0003
The Grado Empire will repay the
debt of betrayal with blood!@0003@000C@0016...@0016His Majesty relies upon you, Captain.

My brother and I used to pass
through here en route to Grado.@0003
I remember the harmony in which the
people of both countries lived.@0003
No walls divided our borders. No
soldiers stood guard in high towers.@0003
This border town@0016... @0016It was to me a symbol
of the trust between Grado and Renais.@0003@000C@0016...@0016And now, it is firmly under
the thumb of Grado's emperor.@0003@0009The peace I remember in this city@0016...@0016@0003
It seems like something from another
time. It seems lost now@0016... @0016Forever.@0003@000C@0016...@0016The city doesn't seem to be very
heavily patrolled.@0003
They must feel it's not worth guarding
with Castle Renais under their control.@0003
We must try to not draw attention to
ourselves. The west gate is undermanned@0016...@0016@0003@0080@0004@000F@0010@0120@000FPardon me, may I ask

My name is Natasha.@0003
I was a servant of the people
at Grado's Imperial Temple.@0003@000AThen why the trouble with the soldiers?
Would you tell us your story?@0003@000COf course@0016...@0016@0003
A few days past, my mentor was 
arrested without warning.@0003
They executed him.
They said he was a traitor@0016...@0016@0003
But those were false accusations.@0003
The emperor had him killed@0016--@0016a holy
man!@0016--@0016to keep him silent.@0003@0008Keep him silent?@0003@000CYes. My mentor told me with
his final breath.@0003
The emperor plans to destroy
the Sacred Stones.@0003@000AThe Sacred Stones? Destroy them?@0003@000CAs you must know, the Sacred Stones drove
back the power of evil long ago.@0003
Even now, each of our nations is home
to one of these legendary treasures.@0003
There's one in my homeland, Grado, and
one in your Renais@0016...@0016@0003@000AYes, the Sacred Stone of Renais is
still housed in our royal temple.@0003@000CThe emperor plans to destroy the
five stones, one by one@0016...@0016@0003@0008Why would he do such a thing?@0003
Legend says the Sacred Stones are
even now all that keeps evil at bay!@0003@000CI cannot begin to guess his motives@0016...@0016@0003
You must know, our emperor was a gentle
man. But one day, he changed. Utterly.@0003
Before my mentor died, he said the keepers
of the Sacred Stones must be warned.@0003
I tried to slip across the border, but
the soldiers spotted me@0016...@0016@0003@000AIs that what happened@0016...@0016@0003
What do you think, Seth?@0003@0008I think we can trust no one from Grado.
Not in these times. Not without proof.@0003
However, if what she says is true, we
cannot ignore the danger we face.@0003
Destroying the Sacred Stones@0016...@0016
We cannot allow that to happen.@0003@000AI agree. If only we knew if there were
some reason for the emperor's actions.@0003

She must have meant five stones that
banished evil from Magvel long ago.@0003@000AAnd the emperor@0016--@0016Grado's emperor?
Is he trying to destroy them?@0003
What does that mean?@0003@0008I don't know.@0003

Are you perchance@0016...@0016@0003
Princess Eirika?@0003@000CI am.@0003@0009Oh@0016... @0016Thank goodness you're safe!
I can't tell you how happy I am.@0003
And please accept my gratitude for
driving off that Captain Saar.@0003
That Saar treated all the citizens of Renais
with such contempt and brutality@0016...@0016@0003@000CNot here@0016...@0016not in this city.@0003
My brother and I spent such
happy times here with Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@0009I beg your pardon, but it will not be
long before Grado sends more troops.@0003
Please, you must go quickly.@0003@000CI'm so sorry.@0003
There's nothing I can do for
you now. Please forgive me.@0003@0009Do not be troubled.
Princess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003
We will survive and wait for the
day of liberation to come.@0003
There will come a day when you, Prince
Ephraim, and all of Renais rise up@0016...@0016@0003
Until that day of glory comes, we will
wait unbowed and filled with hope.@0003

@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@012A@0009You@0016... @0016You're that man I met@0016...@0016@0003
Are you here to capture me? You've been
hired to silence me, haven't you@0016...@0016@0003@000CYeah, Grado's paying the bill.
They want you dead, you know?@0003
But don't feel bad. It's not personal.@0003@0009Wait, please@0016...@0016@0003
It doesn't matter what happens to
me, but you must hear my words.@0003
The emperor of Grado is changed.
He is not the man he once was.@0003
The other nations must be warned before
he extinguishes all light from our lands.@0003@000CHey, no offense, but I'm just a mercenary.
I don't care about Grado or its emperor.@0003
Everything you say may be true, or it may
be lies. I don't care either way.@0003@0009But that's@0016...@0016@0003@000CEven so@0016... @0016Killing a beautiful lady like
you would leave a bad taste in my mouth.@0003@0002
Tell me, do you like to gamble?@0003@0009What?!@0003@000CGambling's what I live for. Even
when I lose, I never want to stop.@0003
Let's have us a little wager.
If you win, I'll believe you.@0003
Heads or tails, you call it.@0003@0009You can't@0016...@0016
This is no time for games@0016...@0016@0003@000CWould you rather I get on with the
job I was hired for?@0003@0009@0016......@0016
Um, heads@0016...@0016@0003
No! Tails!@0003@000CAll right. So I'm heads,
and you're tails.@0003
Here we go.@0007
@0016... ... ...@0016@0003@0009@0016......@0016
Which@0016... @0016Which is it?@0003@0080@0004@0017@000CWhat do you know?!@0003@0002
It's tails. You win. Figures.
I haven't won anything all day.@0003
Well, Lady Luck has spoken.
Guess I'm on your side now.@0003@0009Are you serious?@0003@000CYeah. Sure, I might cheat, but I never
worm out of a bet. It's a rule of mine.@0003@0009Oh, thank heaven! Thank you, blessed
light, for your protection!@0003@000CI got nothing against heaven, but I'm right
here if you want someone to thank@0016...@0016@0003
No? Well, get behind me then. I've
got to take care of these fools.@0003
# 0x09CD
@0009@0010@0158@000C@0010@FFFF@0009Life in Serafew's been harder since the
Grado occupation force took over here.@0003
Serafew's got Renais citizens as well as
Grado, but it's been hardest on us.@0003
They've singled out families from
Renais for the most awful atrocities.@0003@0002
Please, traveler, take this sword.@0003
It's an armorslayer. It'll cut through
even the strongest armor.@0003
Take it and strike down that
blackheart, Saar.@0003
# 0x09CE
@0017@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@FFFF@0009Oh, hello.
Did you come to see me dance?@0003
I'm sorry, but I just finished a
few moments ago.@0003@0002
Oh, by the way@0016... @0016Would you be interested
in one of these items?@0003
A wealthy patron left me a small ransom
in gifts after watching my performance.@0003
You can sell one for gold if you'd like
or use them to improve your skills.@0003
I simply cannot carry all of this by
myself, so please, take this one.@0003
Wealth is useless if you can't use it
to bring happiness to others, right?@0003
Thanks for dropping by. Perhaps we'll
meet again someday.@0003@0009@0080@001F
# 0x09CF
@0009@0010@0159@000C@0010@FFFF@0009In my youth, I was a knight of some
renown, I'll have you know.@0003
I've even crossed blades with one of
Grado's most famous generals, I have.@0003
Ah, but I'm an old man now@0016...@0016@0003
I'm starting to worry@0016... @0016What if I die
without passing on my techniques?@0003
So I decided to write down what I've
learned in a book. I have it here.@0003
You seem like a strong warrior. I'd
be honored if you would accept it.@0003
# 0x09D0
@0017@0009@0010@0119@0009Hope everyone's well back home in Silva.
Just a bit more, and I'll be in the empire.@0003
Let's see, I've got vulneraries,
antitoxins@0016...@0016@0003
Oh! And I can't let myself forget torches
for when it gets dark.@0003
Yep! I'm all set!
Now I just need to get to the capital.@0003
I'll be the finest soldier the
Grado army's ever seen! I swear it!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@FFFF@000CHm?@0004 What's this@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x09D1
Sometimes, you can talk to an enemy and
convince him to join you.@0003
For example, right now, @0080@0021Joshua@0080@0021 might
be inclined to talk with @0080@0021Natasha@0080@0021.@0003@0002
However, @0080@0021Joshua@0080@0021 is a @0080@0021red unit@0080@0021.@0003
Unlike green units you've seen before,
he will @0080@0021attack@0080@0021 until he's spoken to.@0003
Moreover, @0080@0021Joshua@0080@0021 is a @0080@0021myrmidon@0080@0021, who
specializes in @0080@0021critical hits@0080@0021.@0003
If you are struck by a @0080@0021critical hit@0080@0021, you
will suffer 3 times the normal damage.@0003
It's a good idea to check @0080@0021Crit@0080@0021
on the combat information window.@0003
# 0x09D2
You got an armorslayer.@0003
This weapon is similar to rapiers in
that you can severely injure knights
and generals with a single blow.@0003
In such cases, the weapon icon on the
combat information window will flash.@0003
# 0x09D3
There's an @0080@0021armory@0080@0021 and a
@0080@0021shop@0080@0021 in this city.@0003
# 0x09D4
@0080@0021Armories@0080@0021 sell iron swords, steel
lances, and other weapons.@0003
@0080@0021Shops@0080@0021 carry spells, vulneraries,
and a myriad of other items.@0003
If you're running short on anything,
make sure you stock up here.@0003
# 0x09D5
There's an @0080@0021arena@0080@0021 here.@0003
# 0x09D6
Arenas play host to @0080@0021one-on-one
combat matches@0080@0021.@0003
If you win a match, you'll earn @0080@0021twice
the amount of the entry fee@0080@0021.@0003
If you lose, however, that unit @0080@0021will not
be able to fight in any future battles@0080@0021.@0003
If your HP drops near zero in a fight,
@0080@0021press the B Button quickly@0080@0021 to concede.@0003
You'll lose your entry fee, but you'll
save your unit to fight again.@0003
# 0x09D7
@0009@0010@0138@000C@0010@0142@0009What a pleasant surprise.
It's Master Valter.@0003@000CWhat's the situation, Tirado? You
have captured Ephraim, haven't you?@0003@0009No. Prince Ephraim still fights
in the lands north of Renvall.@0003@000CAnd why is that?@0003
What has happened to all
those mercenaries you hired?@0003@0009They've proven to be less than adequate.@0003
Ephraim's clever. His band strikes quickly
and then vanishes into the woods.@0003
We more than double his numbers, and yet
he uses the terrain wisely to fight us.@0003
He has no army@0016--@0016just a small force
of knights loyal to Renais.@0003
Prince Ephraim's reputation as a superb
strategist would seem to be well earned.@0003@000CHmm@0016...@0016@0003
How interesting. The lad's beginning
to whet my appetite.@0003
Tirado@0016... @0016Bring him to me as quickly
as you can, will you?@0003@0009As you command.@0003
Just grant me an army, and
I'll bring him down swiftly.@0003@000CWhat sort of plan do you have?@0003@0009Master, I am your loyal adjutant,
and you are my general.@0003
For you, my lord, I have many
plans ready and waiting.@0003@000CReally? Well then,
let me hear them.@0003@0009Very well. @0003
First, you and I will leave this
fort and head north.@0003
Then, we will find Prince Ephraim
in his leafy playpen.@0003@000CBut he's not easily found, is he?@0003@0009Do not worry.@0003
At Prince Ephraim's side is@0016...@0016
a friend, shall we say.@0003
When the time is right, our friend
will move on our behalf@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x09D8
@0009@0010@0114@000B@0010@0116@000D@0010@0118@001C@0009Forde, how are we on
supplies and equipment?@0003@000BIt's not looking good.@0003
Our weapons are in bad shape,
and we're running low on food.@0003
We can probably restock at a
nearby village, but@0016--@0016@0003@0009No, that's not an option.@0003
We're in enemy territory. I will not
involve innocents if I can avoid it.@0003@000BYeah, I knew you'd say that.@0003
I mean, it's because of stuff like that
that we've stuck with you so far.@0003
But eventually, we do need to face
reality. What are we going to do?@0003@000DWord of mouth has it that the invasion
of Renais has progressed quite far.@0003
I've heard that the capital has fallen.@0003@0009Hm@0016... @0016So soon@0016...@0016@0003
Still, my father is in the capital,
and he won't surrender easily.@0003@0002
Forde, Kyle.@0003
Our mission here is to harry the
troops, to distract their eye.@0003
Hopefully, we'll be able to give my
father and Eirika time to escape.@0003@0015@0009Kyle, have you heard anything from
Orson? I sent him ahead to scout.@0003@000DNo word yet, and it's about
time he returned@0016...@0016@0003@000B@0011@000D@0011@001D@000C@0010@0145@000CReporting in, Prince Ephraim.@0003
I can confirm Grado presence at
several points around our camp.@0003
Also, a large battalion of soldiers
has been dispatched from Renvall.@0003
We shouldn't tarry here any longer
than necessary@0016...@0016@0003@0009I see.@0003@000C@0011@000C@0010@0116@000CSeems as though we've certainly
caught Grado's eye this time.@0003
Should we retreat back to the
capital, Prince Ephraim?@0003@0009No. We press onward.@0003
We're going to capture Renvall.@0003@000CWh-what?!?@0003
# 0x09D9
@0009@0010@0114@000B@0010@0116@000D@0010@0118@0009So this is Renvall, is it?@0003
All right, let's go.@0003@000BUm@0016... @0016Are you@0016...@0016sure you're
quite sane, Prince Ephraim?@0003
We've an entire army after us, and
you want to charge their stronghold?@0003@000DForde! Watch your tongue! This 
is our prince you're addressing!@0003@0009Kyle, please, it's all right.
We've heard nothing from home,@0003
so what harm could a little
reckless besieging cause?@0003@000DPrince Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@0009Don't worry. I haven't lost all sense
of self-preservation.@0003
Renvall holds an important place in
Grado's national defense.@0003
If we can get the upper hand
and take control of it,@0003
then Grado will waste many valuable
soldiers trying to take it back.@0003
I hope our attack proves useful
to my father and Eirika.@0003@001C@000BI understand what you're saying, but@0016...@0016@0003
can we do it with our current strength?@0003@0009Every soldier in this area is
trying to find us.@0003
The enemy has us vastly outnumbered.
Attacking the castle is a ridiculous idea.@0003
If the enemy thinks the same@0016...@0016
then we may have our opening.@0003@000BYou have a point. I'm sure Renvall won't
expect us to attack with these numbers.@0003
Either way, we can't run forever.
And we're running out of supplies.@0003
What've we got to lose?
Shall we get ready to go?@0003@0009Yes. If we don't move quickly, we
may never get another chance.@0003@0002
Trust me. I don't pick fights I
cannot win.@0003@000DYes, sir!@0003
# 0x09DA
@0009@0010@0135@0009An attack? By Ephraim's troops?@0003
To arms! Prince Ephraim's circled around
and brought the fight to us!@0003
If we capture the prince here, we can
line our pockets with gold!@0003
Do you understand? We'll be rich!@0003
# 0x09DB
@0009@0010@0114@0009Orson.@0003@000C@0010@0145@000CYes@0016...@0016@0003@0009Your wounds still haven't healed
from that last battle, have they?@0003
Don't push yourself.@0003
If we're defeated, you must return
to Frelia. Understood?@0003@000CUnderstood@0016...@0016@0003@0009Let's go!
Kyle! Forde!@0003
# 0x09DC
@000C@0010@0116@000COh, that hurt@0016...@0016@0003
I'm sorry, Prince Ephraim.
I have to fall back.@0003
# 0x09DD
@000C@0010@0118@000CI was careless@0016...@0016
My apologies, Prince Ephraim.@0003
I must withdraw.@0003

I have... no regrets...@0003

# 0x09E1
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0118@000CWe've secured the entire castle.@0003
You were brilliant, Prince Ephraim!
What a plan! What a battle!@0003@0009I estimate at least half of the
enemy troops are in the field.@0003
We took the castle, but we don't have the
manpower to hold it in a siege.@0003
There's no point in lingering here.
Let's continue on to Grado Keep.@0003
# 0x09E2
@000A@0010@0114@0008@0010@0118@000C@0010@0116@001C@000CPrince Ephraim, things have
taken a turn for the worse.@0003
I took a look around the castle perimeter@0016...@0016@0003@0002
We're surrounded.@0003@0008What?@0003@000AGrado's sent reinforcements?
So quickly@0016...?@0016@0003@0008What should we do?@0003@000A@0016......@0016@0003@0002
We must escape!@0003
# 0x09E3
@000C@0010@0114@0009@0010@0142@0009So, you've captured Renvall, have you?
And with such a small force! Impressive!@0003
You've earned your reputation. I must say,
I quite admire your work.@0003@0002
I take it you're the leader of this
pack@0016--@0016the misguided Prince Ephraim.@0003@000CI am.@0003@0009I'm General Valter, the Moonstone
of Grado's Imperial Army.@0003
Catching up to you has caused me
no small amount of trouble.@0003
We've reduced your wretched home
of Renais to ruin, and yet@0016...@0016@0003
you and your little band of bravos
continue to be a thorn in our side.@0003@0002
But that all ends here.@0003@000C@0080@000D@000BWe'll see@0016... @0016You claim you've
taken the capital of Renais@0016...@0016@0003
Tell me, how did you know
I would attack Renvall?@0003@0009Ha ha@0016... @0016Patience. You'll have
your answer soon enough.@0003
Now, be good lads, and drop
your weapons, will you?@0003@000D@0010@0118@000DPrince Ephraim, let us attack!@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0009Listen to me, Ephraim. You're a smart
man. You know it's futile to fight me.@0003
You cannot win.
You cannot escape.@0003
Accept the reality of your situation,
and surrender to me.@0003@000BSurrender?@0003@0009Heh heh heh@0016... @0016That's right.
If you do, I'll let you live.@0003
I hold your life in the palm of my
hand. Do not test my good humor.@0003
Now come over here, bend your
knee, and beg for your life.@0003
Show me how Renais dogs grovel.@0003@000BI think not.@0003@0009What?@0003@000BYou said your name was Valter, didn't you?@0003
Well, I'm sorry, Valter, but I don't have
time to waste playing games with you.@0003
So, we're going to knock you louts about a
bit and then make our way out of here.@0003@0009Fool@0016... @0016Have you gone mad?@0003
Do you truly believe you can fight
your way past my wyvern knights?@0003@000BWatch and see. I don't pick
fights I can't win.@0003@0002
Kyle, Forde.
Are you ready?@0003@000DMy life has been yours since the
moment I took my chivalric vows.@0003@000D@0011@000D@0010@0116@000D@0017It's moments like these that
keep me by your side, my prince.@0003@0017@000D@0011@0009What idiotic wretches you are@0016...@0016@0003
Prepare yourselves to be
destroyed utterly!@0003@000BWe break to the east. GO!@0003
# 0x09E4
@0009@0010@0148@000C@0010@0136@0009@0017So, tell me@0016...@0016@0003
You have ascertained Eirika's
whereabouts, have you not?@0003@0017@000CI have.@0003
I sent some of our men to follow
the princess as she fled Serafew.@0003
They tell me Eirika and her friends
will be coming this way shortly.@0003
Our ambush is ready and waiting.

That's reason enough.@0003

me a general, and I will be famous.@0003

Prince Ephraim, have you not?@0003
A fool's errand. Ephraim fell before

And you invaded without warning. You
ravaged our land. You killed my father@0016...@0016@0003
Even then, I told myself I must not hate
Grado or her people.@0003
If I gave in to my hate, the bond between

I refused to hate. Instead, I lived for the

@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0104@0009Your late father, King Fado@0016...@0016@0003
He ordered me to keep silent until
the proper time arrived.@0003
However, with all that has happened,
with Emperor Vigarde's actions@0016...@0016@0003
I feel it imperative that I tell
you everything, Princess Eirika.@0003
Are you ready to hear the secret
of the bracelet you wear?@0003@000CI am@0016...@0016@0003@0009As you know, Princess@0016...@0016@0003
Renais houses one of the
legendary Sacred Stones.@0003@000COf course. It's in the temple. It's
supposed to be a ward against evil.@0003@0009Yes, the true stone is. But the stone
in the temple is nothing but a forgery.@0003
The real Sacred Stone of Renais lies
beneath the royal castle.@0003
Guarding it is a powerful seal, an
infinitely complex lock of sorts.@0003@000CWhat?@0003
Is this true?@0003@0009Yes. King Fado confided in me himself.@0003
The Sacred Stones banished evil long ago
and possess powers beyond our ken.@0003
The ancient kings of Renais felt it
prudent to seal ours away.@0003
They feared its power could be misused.
They thought to remove the temptation.@0003
The keys to break the seal were hidden,
too@0016... @0016Forged into bracelets@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016The very ones that you and your
brother, Prince Ephraim, wear.@0003@000COur bracelets?@0003
How could Father keep this a
secret from me for so long?@0003@0009They must know nothing of the bracelets.
Tell them only if some great peril strikes.@0003
These were King Fado's exact orders.@0003
Prince Ephraim knows nothing of the
bracelets' secret, either.@0003
The king told me this out of fear that
something might happen to him.@0003
So that, when the time came, the two of you
would learn the truth.@0003@000CThe bracelets have such meaning@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yes. And we are the only living souls who
know the secret of the Stone of Renais.@0003
At least, that's what I was given to
believe. And yet@0016...@0016@0003@0080@0004@000CYet the Grado army has made it clear
that they want me only for my bracelet.@0003@0009Yes, quite clear at that@0016...@0016@0003
I don't know how, but Emperor Vigarde
must have learned the secret somehow.@0003
And now, his troops pursue the bracelet, and
we are no closer to knowing his motives.@0003@000CHe would use the bracelets to unlock the
Sacred Stone and destroy it in secret@0016...@0016@0003@0009Perhaps.@0003@000CWhich means that my brother@0016...@0016
and his bracelet@0016...@0016@0003@0009If he's been captured, they may have the
bracelet already, and he may be@0016--@0016@0003@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003@0009Princess, we must take Novala's words to
be true. We must hurry to Prince Ephraim.@0003
The enemy soldiers who fled the battle will
have reported our location by now.@0003
If the prince is being held prisoner
at Renvall@0016...@0016@0003
I fear they might execute him once they
learn of our approach.@0003@000CYou're right. We've no time to waste.@0003
We must hurry to Renvall!
Let's go rescue my brother!@0003

stocked up on antitoxins@0016...@0016@0003
This antitoxin's strong stuff. No need
to worry about poison with this around.@0003
Hey! Why don't you go ahead and take
one. Go on, you may need it.@0003
They might still eat you, but at least
they won't be able to poison you!@0003
# 0x09F4
A heavy fog has rolled in.@0003
Fog limits your range of vision and
makes it hard to determine where enemy
troops are hiding.@0003
You don't want to run into enemies
unprepared, so proceed with caution.@0003@0002
Also remember, @0080@0021thieves@0080@0021 have better
ranges of vision than other units, so
they make good scouts. If you're on a
foggy map, be sure to include @0080@0021thieves@0080@0021
in your party.@0003@0002
If you don't have any @0080@0021thieves@0080@0021, other units
can extend their vision ranges by using
@0080@0021torches@0080@0021.@0003
Seeing is vital in combat, so use @0080@0021thieves@0080@0021,
@0080@0021torches@0080@0021, and other items to
gain the upper hand.@0003
# 0x09F5
You got an @0080@0021antitoxin@0080@0021.@0003
Antitoxins are valuable if your units
get struck with a poisoned attack.@0003
Some enemies wield poisoned weapons.
Additionally, there are poisonous
spiders lurking about on this map.@0003
If you get poisoned, simply use an
@0080@0021antitoxin@0080@0021 to heal yourself.@0003

Prince Ephraim and I were both captured by
Grado forces and held here as prisoners.@0003

Where is my brother?@0003@000CIf he lives still, he will be in one

How long ago were you
taken prisoner?@0003@0009Some two weeks past. Prince Ephraim
and I were forced to surrender.@0003
We've been held captive here in this
dungeon since that black day.@0003@000DDid you gain any news from your
captors during that time?@0003@0009Unfortunately, no. Not a word@0016...@0016@0003
Our daily meal was brought to us by
servants from the neighboring village.@0003
They were instructed not to speak to
us, and we heard nothing of the war.@0003
Tell me, Seth.
How fares Renais?@0003@000D@0016...@0016Renais has fallen. King Fado@0016...@0016
The king is dead.@0003@0009Dead@0016...@0016 My king@0016...@0016@0003
My apologies, Princess Eirika.
I have served you poorly@0016...@0016@0003@000BYou're not to blame, Sir Orson.@0003
We must look to the future, not
find fault in the past.@0003
The Grado army pursues me in 
hopes of acquiring my bracelet.@0003
My brother wears this bracelet's
twin, and he is in danger, too.@0003@0009Bracelet?@0003
Ah, I remember@0016... @0016Prince Ephraim
still wears the bracelet.@0003
And Grado is after them?@0003
If that's the case, Princess@0016...@0016@0003
Perhaps you should entrust the
bracelets to someone else.@0003@000BPerhaps, but@0016...@0016@0003@0009Give them to me or to Seth. Let
someone you trust guard them.@0003
If the empire desires your bracelet, you
are in danger as long as you hold it.@0003
For your own safety, Your Highness,
please. What say you?@0003
We must not allow the Sacred Stone
of Renais to be taken.@0003@000BEverything you say is true
and sensible, yet@0016...@0016@0003@0080@0004@000D@0011@000B@0011@000D@0010@0102@000B@0010@0104@000B@0016...@0016Sir Orson.@0003
I am sorry for this, but
please give me your weapons.@0003@000DSeth?@0003@0009What are you talking about, Seth?@0003
Can't you see I'm unarmed? Do you
think they allow prisoners weapons?@0003
What kind of injury have you taken
that you suggest such foolishness?@0003@000BIf I am mistaken, then I will give
you all due apologies.@0003
However, there are questions I have
that I cannot answer. Too many questions.@0003@0002
Why did no enemy reinforcements come from
the castle during our battle outside?@0003
Why would you escape your cell and yet
leave Prince Ephraim in chains?@0003
How do you know of the tie between the
bracelets and the Sacred Stone?@0003@0009Seth, there is some misunderstanding
here. I@0016...@0016@0003@000BAnd why@0016...@0016@0003
Why do you conceal a blade
within your doublet?@0003@000D@0016...@0016What?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Very well.@0003
You haven't changed a bit, Seth.@0003
If only Eirika had been alone. You,
however, simply will not be deceived.@0003@000DOrson! What is the@0016--@0016@0003@000BOrson. Why did you
betray Renais?@0003@0009@0017My fondest wish will be granted@0016...@0016@0003
To spend the rest of my days in the
embrace of my loving wife once more@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000DWhat are you saying?@0003

Loyal and talented aide to Valter,
general of the Grado army.@0003@000BYou're that monster's@0016--@0016@0003@0009And you are General Seth of Renais, yes?@0003
I thought to catch a little bird in my net,
and it seems instead I've snared a hawk.@0003@000DWhere is my brother?!@0003@0009Ah, yes. Your brother. He's not here.@0003
The coward fled Lord Valter's pursuit@0016...@0016
Somehow, he escaped the castle.@0003@0002
And escaping under these conditions@0016...@0016
Tch! Such stubbornness is quite annoying.@0003@0002
It was my cunning that led us to turn this
unfortunate blunder to our advantage.@0003
I spread the rumors myself. I led the
villagers to believe he was our prisoner.@0003
What better trap with which to catch
his sweet, devoted sister?@0003@000DMy brother escaped?@0003@0009Yes, but your no-doubt emotional reunion
will have to wait until the afterlife.@0003@0002

your only avenue of escape@0016...@0016@0003

I am the finest mage in Belaro!
You there, Imperial! Come!@0003@000C@0010@011A@000C... Yes?@0003@0009Is that how you speak to 
your commanding officers?@0003
You Imperials think you're
superior to us folk in the country,@0003
and so you treat us poorly. What
crime did you commit to get you@0003
sent out here?
No matter, we have company.@0003
You are to follow my orders,
understood?@0003@000C... Yes, Commander Gelt.
What are my orders, sir?@0003@0009That's better.
You will engage with the enemy.@0003
The rebel Titus is here with a small
force. You will capture him alive.@0003
Kill the rest. Understood?@0003@000CYes, Commander Gelt.
... I will not fail.@0003@0009Good.@0003@0009@0011@000CHow much longer do I need 
to take this for?@0003
General Bromhilda surely sees this
too... Are we fighting for the wrong@0003
side? The people are suffering, and
Lord Gradin and his men seem to@0003
care little for the welfare of the people.
No... I can't disobey orders.@0003
That would reflect poorly on the General.
I cannot jeopardize her position.@0003
I know she is skeptical of Gradin's aims too.

with Princess Eirika first.@0003
We should be able to reach them
by way of the eastern corridor.@0003@000BCome now, Kyle.@0003
That seems like a lot of trouble when
we could just crush Grado between us.@0003@000DA lot of trouble? Forde, you're as
insolent as you are careless!@0003

@0009Apologies for my manners, milord.@0003
I am Erasmus, a Commander from the
Imperial Army.@0003
I was sent her with General Bromhilda
to quell your rebellion.@0003
@000CBy your tone,
I can sense that this is not@0003
what you desire, correct?@0003
@0009Indeed. Something is amiss,
Lord Titus. I am unsure of Gradn's aims,@0003
and even more doubtful of 
Emperor Festan's interests in Belaro.@0003
This doubt... it does not sit well with me.@0003
@000CSo, will you join us?@0003
Surely a capable soldier that has
ascended to rank of Commander@0003
in the Imperial Army would be
a welcome addition to our forces.@0003
@0009Your offer is most gracious,
but I cannot betray General Bromhilda.@0003
I must speak with her. 
This is not our fight, nor is it@0003
within our right to intervene.@0003
I have seen much of what
Gradin has done to this state,@0003
and I believe your fight to be just.
Please, allow me to escape and speak@0003
with the General. I can only hope
that will make your path to victory@0003
an easier one.@0003
@000CErasmus, was it?@0003
I'll remember your service to us
on this day. General Bromhilda is@0003
one of the most fearsome warriors
Nevan has ever seen...@0003
For her to withdraw, yes, it would
be most advantageous to us.@0003
Thank you, my sincerest thanks!@0003
@0009... Right.@0003
I'll be seeing you, or maybe
I won't. Doubt after I speak with@0003

I understand you both have 
close relations with Lord Gradin.@0003@0009I admit, I do not look forward
to crossing spears with my sister,@0003
but I have made my choice, 
and am unwavering in my resolve.@0003
While Lord Gradin has been 
most gracious to us, our ideals@0003
are not aligned. 
The people are suffering,@0003
and Emperor Festan...
He has a strange hold on Lord Gradin.@0003
And my sister...
General Lesley too has changed.@0003
She turns a blind eye to the truth.@0003
But tell me this, Lord Titus,
and pardon me for speaking so...@0003
directly, but is my choice to 
fight against my sister,@0003
any different from your war
against your uncle?@0003@000CNo... I suppose not.@0003

Take the Frelian army
and punish Ephraim.@0003@0015@000C@0011@000C@0010@013F@0009Selena.

@000E@0010@012C@000D@0010@0102@000EEirika! Wait!@0003@0015@000E@0080@000B@000D@0080@000E@000CTana?
What are you doing?@0003
You were supposed to
remain in the palace.@0003@0009You left so abruptly, without
any warning or farewell.@0003
You and Ephraim have only just arrived,
and already you leave on another quest?@0003
Well, I'm your friend, Eirika, and I won't
let you go into danger without me.@0003@000CDoes King Hayden know of this?@0003@0009No. He'd just say, I forbid you to go
on this foolish errand, like always.@0003
But I'm so worried about you.@0003@000CThank you, Tana.@0003
I appreciate your concern,
but King Hayden would@0016--@0016@0003@0009You and Ephraim, my father and
my brother@0016...@0016@0003
You're all fighting together,
fighting for a noble cause.@0003
I cannot be left out.
I will not be left out.@0003
Please, Eirika.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Oh@0016...@0016@0003
All right.
I never could refuse you anything.@0003
Come on. Let's go, Tana.@0003@0009Thank you, Eirika!@0003

@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0104@000CYour Highness, we've reached Port Kiris.@0003
If we can find passage across the North
Sea, we will reach Rausten in 10 days.@0003@0009It smells of the tides@0016...@0016
This is a busy place, isn't it?@0003@000CIt's a trade center. Peoples of all
nations pass through here.@0003
Do not become so enthralled with the sights
and sounds that you forget your mission.@0003@0009I won't.@0003
I'm a mercenary by the name of Erina.@0003
I'm traveling to Rausten to
receive a commission.@0003@000CLet us look for a ship then, Erina.
The docks are this way.@0003@0009@0080@000C@0080@0004@000AHm?@0003@000CIs something amiss?@0003@000ASeth, that woman over there?
Is that@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0A1B
@0017@000B@0010@0122@000D@0010@0123@000BOh, these dainty sugar pastries!
They're delightfully scrumptious!@0003
Flavorful without being overwhelming,
refined without being banal@0016...@0016@0003@000DGwah ha ha!
Right you are, Lady L'Arachel!@0003@000E@0010@0102@000E@0080@000A@0008You look familiar@0016...@0016@0003@000BOh!
Aren't you@0016--@0016@0003@0008We've met before, haven't we?@0003
You arrived with your companions
when we encountered those creatures@0016...@0016@0003
Your name is L'Arachel, is it not?@0003@000BA wonder and pleasure that we should meet
again so soon! It is providence!@0003@000D@0011@000D@0010@0124@000DBad luck is the only thing the
divine has ever provided you!@0003@000BOh, and if you have not yet tried
one, these pastries are also divine.@0003
Would you care for one?@0003@0017@0008Uh, thank you@0016...@0016@0003
No, wait@0016... @0016That's not why@0016--@0016@0003
@0080@0004We're actually on our way to the
Theocracy of Rausten.@0003
We're rather in a rush and need to
find passage on a ship@0016...@0016@0003@000BOh, dear. I'm afraid you'll find none to
assist you. No ships are leaving port.@0003@0008Pardon?@0003@000BYou see, I find myself heading home once
more to my beloved Rausten as well!@0003
And actually, I'm quite well known with
the powers-that-be here in Port Kiris.@0003
So I ordered them to ready the finest
passenger vessel for me.@0003@0002
But both merchants and passenger ships
alike are too frightened to set sail.@0003
It seems a giant ghost ship has been
sinking every ship it finds@0016...@0016@0003
Would that I could confront it, I could
stop its foul villainy in a moment.@0003
Alas. It's such a shame.@0003@0008Yes, yes@0016... @0016Uh@0016...@0016@0003
That is troublesome. Still,
I must get to Rausten somehow.@0003@000BYou needn't worry too much.@0003
After all, if the sea is closed to
you, simply follow the overland route!@0003@0008The overland route?@0003
I've heard that's a terribly
roundabout path to travel.@0003@0017@000BOh, it is, but don't you see? The hardships
of the road, they are truly blessings!@0003
They will toughen you and strengthen your
resolve when you need to face great evil.@0003
For example, I have been tasked with a
great trial in order to better me.@0003
I understand my path, O unknowable
forces of providence!@0003
I, your faithful servant L'Arachel, shall
overcome! With faith and divine strength!@0003@000DNow, listen, L'Arachel! You might be
thrilled about going the long way, but@0016--@0016@0003@000BCome now, we're leaving.
Dozla? Rennac?@0003
Don't fall behind!@0003@000B@0011@000B@0010@0123@000BGwah ha ha! Wait for us,
Lady L'Arachel!@0003
Come on, Rennac!
We run 'til we drop!@0003
The first one to collapse from
exhaustion is the winner!@0003@000B@0011@0017@000DHelp@0016...@0016
Why is this happening to me?@0003@000D@0011

Isn't Rausten in the other direction?
Aren't they heading toward Frelia?@0003@0009@0016...@0016It's nothing you need
concern yourself with, milady.@0003@0015@0009Our only concern now is to decide
our next course of action.@0003
An overland journey would be very long.@0003
However, it seems that may be our only
choice at the moment@0016...@0016@0003@000CI agree.
Whatever shall we do@0016...@0016@0003

princess of Renais, ain't ya?@0003@000DWhat?@0003@000BDastard! Away with you!@0003@0009No need to get personal!@0003
You know, there's a pretty
price on your pretty head.@0003
Sorry, but I need that gold.@0003
# 0x0A1E
@000C@0010@0119@0009@0010@016B@0009Attention!@0003
Carcino's mercenaries will arrest the
princess of Renais shortly.@0003
Our duty here is nearly ended, and
I expect no further hostilities.@0003
If you must fight, however, remember
that the whole empire fights with you!@0003@000CUm, Commander?@0003
What should I do?@0003@0009Who are you?@0003@000CSir! I'm Amelia of Silva, sir!@0003
I'm new. I was only assigned to your command
today. I wanted to fight for the empire!@0003@0009I don't need your life story, fool! Recruits
are in front! Grab a lance and move!@0003@000CSir, yes sir!@0003@0002
This lance@0016... @0016Stab the enemy.@0003
I'm not afraid@0016...@0016@0003
I'm a citizen of Grado.
It's my duty to fight.@0003
And I'll fight my best!@0003
# 0x0A1F
@000C@0010@0119@0009@0010@016B@0009Hrm@0016... @0016This battle isn't going
well at all.@0003
Stinking mercenaries! All a
bunch of worthless slugs.@0003
I could smash the whole lot of
'em if I had the time, but@0016...@0016@0003
I've got to follow orders. That's
the lot of a soldier, ain't it?@0003
Let's move out, troops! We're
returning to the capital!@0003@0009@0011@000CWhat?@0003
Are we really supposed to leave
with the enemy right there?@0003
Well@0016...@0016at least that means
the fighting is finally over.@0003
# 0x0A20
@0009@0010@0139@0009Blast! Have they come
this far already?@0003
I'll deal with you myself!@0003
# 0x0A21
@0009@0010@0139@0009It isn't over just yet...@0003

@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0102@0009Your Highness, are you well?@0003@000CYes, I believe so@0016...@0016@0003@0015@000CWho are these men?@0003
They don't appear to be
Grado Imperial troops.@0003@0009Judging by their crude swordplay,
I'd say they're mercenaries.@0003
We can expect more of them
in the area, too, I think.@0003
Wait here.@0003
# 0x0A23
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@016D@000CW-wait! I give up!@0003
I don't want to fight anymore!
We were just doing a job.@0003@0009Who hired you?@0003@000CI may be nothing but a hired blade, but
I have my honor. I won't say a word.@0003@0009@0080@000C@000AI admire your professionalism.
I guess we have no use for you.@0003@000C@0080@000F@000DNo, wait! I'll talk!
Carcino!@0003
It was Pablo of the Carcino
Council of Elders!@0003@000ACouncilman Pablo?@0003@001C@0008@0010@0102@0008That doesn't make sense!@0003
Carcino and Frelia are allies.
Why would they target me?@0003@000DI don't know@0016...@0016@0003
Could be they've decided Grado's going to
win. They want to be on the winning side.@0003
Some of the others opposed Pablo, but
I heard he had 'em all silenced but quick.@0003
That's all I know, I swear it.@0003@000AI believe you. Go.@0003
# 0x0A24
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0104@000CWe were careless. We should have seen
this coming.@0003
Carcino's a young and ambitious nation
ruled by power-hungry merchants.@0003
And Grado grows more powerful with
every passing day.@0003
So it's no surprise Carcino's merchant
lords would throw in with Grado now.@0003@0009Wait!
Prince Innes@0016...@0016@0003
Prince Innes was to pass through
Carcino on his way to Jehanna@0016...@0016@0003
If Carcino has betrayed us, then he
ran headlong into enemy territory@0016...@0016@0003

riding with Prince Innes.@0003@0009Yes, and I have news of him.
Prince Innes is in danger!@0003
Carcino's merchant army struck and
cut through half our men.@0003
The prince is trapped in a siege.
He has no means of escape, and@0016--@0016@0003@000CNo more!@0003
I understand. Return to Frelia
and deliver your message!@0003@0009What of Prince Innes?@0003@000CLeave him to us. The prince's
troubles should burden you no more.@0003
We will see him to safety.@0003

to be in the city.@0003@0008Whew@0016... @0016I'm finally free! No more getting
bossed around by that witless ninny!@0003
Thanks. I owe you one.
Take this.@0003
Now that I'm free again. I think I'm
just gonna wander about for a while.@0003@0008@0011@000B@0016...@0016What a strange relationship they have.@0003@000DLady Eirika, I think we

Are you going to make
me your prisoner?!@0003@0009No! No, I wouldn't do that.@0003
But@0016...@0016this is a problem.@0003@000CWhat should we do?@0003@0009First of all, you must listen to
me and do as I say.@0003
We'll talk to Princess Eirika later.@0003@000CWhat? NO!@0003
My commander told me Eirika's a
cruel and merciless fiend who@0016--@0016@0003@0009Oh, that's utter nonsense.@0003
I've never heard the princess
utter an unkind word to anyone.@0003
I understand why you're frightened.
You think we're the enemy.@0003
But if you'd only trust me@0016...@0016
Will you come with me?@0003@0017@000CMm@0016...@0016@0003

anything past you, little brother.@0003
You're right. This duty falls heavily

this princess?@0003@0009Yes. When Renais and Grado were
still close@0016...@0016@0003
I met the girl@0016--@0016
I met Eirika only once.@0003

was a woman of great kindness.@0003
I cannot bring myself to believe
Princess Eirika is evil. I cannot.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Glen.@0003
The emperor has ordered@0016--@0016@0003@0009There's the rub, Cormag.
That's it exactly.@0003
His Majesty has never spoken a falsehood
in all the time I've served him.@0003

toward your peer knights of the realm?@0003
Lest you've forgotten, I, too, am a
general@0016--@0016the same rank as you.@0003@000AYou wretch. You were cast out from the
army for mistreating civilians.@0003
What lies have you told to receive pardon
and reinstatement at the same time?@0003@000COur beloved emperor felt my skills
were needed, and his word is law.@0003
His Majesty has earned my sincerest
and most undying gratitude.@0003
And then we have you three.
Duessel, Selena, and you@0016...@0016@0003
The three of you have proven to be
unreliable time and time again.@0003
We were brought in to plug the holes,
don't you see?@0003
You ought to thank me, Glen!@0003@0008Valter! If you dare insult
my brother further@0016...@0016@0003@000CCome now, Cormag. And what would
you do to me if I did?@0003
Would you fight me? Here? Would you
show such disloyalty to the emperor?@0003@0008@0016...@0016@0003@000APeace, Cormag.@0003
We are His Majesty's men.
We will honor his commands.@0003
Mark my words, Valter: your crimes
are neither forgotten nor forgiven.@0003@000CHmph@0016...@0016@0003

@0009@0010@010F@000B@0010@011B@000D@0010@011C@001C@000BPrince Innes. What do you
say? Can you continue?@0003@0009Yes, of course. Do you believe this
is enough to make me give up?@0003
I am surprised you mercenaries
haven't turned and fled, though.@0003@000BNaw. You see, Gerik's Mercenaries takes its
name from me, Gerik. I'm the chief here.@0003
If I quit while our employer still fought
on, they'd want a new name, you follow me?@0003
So@0016...@0016
What's the plan?@0003@0009Same as before. We remain surrounded.@0003
They're not going to allow us simply
to walk out of here@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I sent a messenger off with news of
our plight.@0003
However, even on the wings of a pegasus
knight, Frelia is days away.@0003
We can expect no help from them.@0003@000BSo we tighten our belts and survive,
is that it?@0003
Or would you rather quit this place
and rest in comfort?@0003@0009Surrender?@0003
I'm the prince of Frelia. I don't know the
meaning of the word.@0003
The fate of the world rides on my shoulders,
and I'll make it to Jehanna.@0003
Even if I have to crawl there to do it.@0003@000B@0017Now, that makes me feel better.@0003
If you're so determined, we may all
live a little while longer@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000DHey, Chief, Prince.@0003@000BWhat is it, Tethys?@0003@000DI've got bad news@0016...@0016and
then I've got worse news.@0003@000BWhat's the bad news?@0003@000DWe've no more weapons in reserve. What
you're holding is what we've got.@0003
Once those are gone, there won't be
much fight left in us.@0003@000BThat is bad news@0016...@0016
Well? What's the worse news?@0003@000DThey've begun to move.
They're going to attack again.@0003
Looks like they're sending up
the whole lot of 'em this time.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
Right. You two, you're done here.
Discharged. Fired. Whatever.@0003
You can surrender or flee.
The choice is yours.@0003@000BWhat?@0003@0009I'm the one they're after.@0003
Throw down your weapons, and
you'll walk away alive.@0003
I don't need you here. You'll
only be in my way.@0003
Who knows? You filthy sellswords'll
probably sell me out anyway.@0003@000DHold on there! That's not
true, and you know it!@0003@000BPeace, Tethys.@0003
Hey, Prince. What
are you going to do?@0003@0009I'm going to get out of here
on my own.@0003
I'll break to the south and
escape into the mountains.@0003@000BThat ain't gonna be easy.
How you plan on doing that?@0003@0009I'm not telling you. I've no idea
when you'll decide to betray me.@0003
Go on. Get out of here.
I'd rather do this alone.@0003@000BSounds like you're trying to make
sure you're the only one who dies.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
Fool. I've no intention of dying.@0003
But there can be no false hope of
reinforcements riding in to save the day.@0003
You and I are not the same. You're a
commoner, and I'm Frelia's heir.@0003
We of noble birth do not shirk the
duties to which we are born.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0009What are you waiting for? You may go.@0003@000BWell played, milord.@0003
I've always loved the
melodrama of martyrdom@0016...@0016@0003
There's no way I can abandon you
after that fine performance.@0003@0002
I'm staying with you.
To the end.@0003@0009To the@0016--@0016
What are you saying?@0003
You dare ignore the orders of the
one who's paying your wages?!@0003@000BTethys, I want you to
go and surrender.@0003
Give my regards to Ewan
and Marisa.@0003@000DDon't be ridiculous.
I'm not going anywhere.@0003
Now would the two of you kindly
stop acting like such@0016...@0016men?@0003
And you! You've already fired us.
You can't order us to leave now.@0003@0009Unbelievable@0016...@0016@0003
And you people call
yourselves mercenaries?@0003
I thought you fought for
money, not for duty.@0003@000BYeah, that's one of the rules.
Guess we're lousy mercenaries, eh?@0003
Now let's get thinking. We still need
a plan to get us all out of here alive.@0003
You're supposed to be a good tactician,
so I figure I won't die easily.@0003
Tell us what to do, Prince.
We'll follow your orders.@0003@0009@0016......@0016
Hm. Very well.@0003
I'll see what I can do to avoid
getting us filled with arrows.@0003@000DAh@0016...@0016
Say, Prince.@0003
If, by some miracle, aid were to come,
from what direction would it arrive?@0003@0009@0016...@0016From the north. But there's
little or no hope of that.@0003
Even if Frelia were to send us aid,
they would not arrive until@0016...@0016@0003@000DThis may be good news@0016...@0016
Then again, it may be more bad news.@0003@0002
There. On that northern mountain path@0016...@0016@0003
Someone's coming.@0003

by the mercenary armies of Carcino.@0003

@0017My plan to get rid of Klimt has
yielded some unexpected fruit.@0003
The head of Frelia's Prince Innes
will make a fine gift to Grado.@0003@000C@0010@016B@000CLord Pablo, Prince Innes and his men have
taken refuge in a mountain stronghold.@0003
Do we have your permission to finish
them off?@0003@0009Yes. Flush the prince out
and cut him down.@0003
We'll find Klimt later and roast
his old bones as well.@0003

@0009@0010@0154@000C@0010@015C@000CLord Klimt, Pablo's troops are moving
toward the stronghold.@0003
It looks like they're planning on chasing
down Prince Innes and his men.@0003@0009Pablo, you mad, reckless imbecile@0016...@0016@0003@0002
If Prince Innes dies here, the bond between
Carcino and Frelia is sundered forever.@0003
Carcino will be nothing more than a
vassal paying tribute to Grado@0016...@0016@0003
We must find some way to aid Prince
Innes.@0003@000CWait, my lord Klimt!@0003
Pablo is after you as well.
If you reveal yourself here@0016...@0016@0003@0009Ahh@0016...@0016@0003

who ordered@0016--@0016@0003@000D@0080@000F@000DP-peace, please!@0003
I have no intention of opposing
you or quarreling with you.@0003
I, too, have been marked for
death by Pablo@0016...@0016@0003@0008What is this all about?@0003@001C@000D@0080@000E@000CIt's a shameful tale@0016...@0016
Carcino is a nation divided.@0003
As you know, Carcino has no king but is
ruled by a council.@0003
But now the council has broken apart
into factions mired in discord@0016...@0016@0003@0008Factions@0016...@0016@0003
You're saying that the whole of
Carcino has not betrayed Frelia?@0003@000CCorrect. The moderate factions prefer to
preserve our alliance with Frelia.@0003
Pablo's faction wishes to endear us to
Grado, to surrender us to their armies.@0003@0002
Once Pablo realized he couldn't ply us with
bribes, he began to have us assassinated.@0003
Those of us who remain have taken refuge
underground. We oppose him where we can.@0003
If you hadn't shown up, I'm not certain
I would still be breathing@0016...@0016@0003@000AI do recall enemy troops combing this area
when I arrived@0016...@0016@0003
They were searching for you, is that it?@0003@000CPablo has usurped rule of the council.
We had no choice but to hide.@0003
Not all of Carcino's council has gone
over to Grado's side, though@0016...@0016@0003
You must believe me@0016--@0016the whole of
Carcino does not believe as Pablo does.@0003@000A@0016...@0016I see.@0003@0008Lord Klimt@0016... @0016I understand the
hardships you've endured.@0003
I am pleased to hear all of
Carcino is not our foe.@0003@000CI will depart at once for Frelia to
explain our circumstance to the king.@0003
I think it is best if you return to
Frelia as well.@0003
Pablo has considerable wealth, and he
commands a vast mercenary force.@0003
I'm sure he'll send more of them this
way as soon as he is able.@0003

if you ask him nicely.@0003@0008What is your teacher's name.@0003@000BMy teacher?
His name is Saleh.@0003@0008Saleh@0016...@0016@0003
I've heard that name on the lips of
Frelia's spy network lately.@0003
He's a powerful wielder of magic who has
been fighting bandits and monsters.@0003
The spies mentioned something about
a Caer Pelyn, if I remember.@0003@000AWhat do you think?@0003@0008Hm. If my spies are accurate, this
Saleh is someone we can trust.@0003@0017@000AVery well, Ewan. Will you take us
to meet your teacher?@0003@000B@0080@000D@000B@0017Not a problem!@0003

What's the good news?@0003@0009Within our band of mercenaries@0016...@0016@0003

Looks like the guild bungled.@0003@0002
They're usually diligent about making sure
this sort of thing doesn't happen.@0003
But here we are, two people of the same
troop, working for opposite sides.@0003@000CWhat should we do?@0003@0009Aye, well, that's a good question@0016...@0016@0003
As a mercenary, your loyalty should always
lie with the person paying your wages.@0003
You decide. We can cross blades if you
want, but I'd rather you retreat.@0003
'Course, if you betray your employer,
you'll soil your sterling name.@0003@000CC'mon, Chief.@0003

@0009@0010@015A@000C@0010@FFFF@0009You know we have no king in
the Republic of Carcino.@0003
We're governed instead by a council
of elders.@0003
It's a lot better than any stuffy,
old monarchy, I can tell you that.@0003
You see, anyone can be a leader in
Carcino if he's old enough.@0003
Of course, maybe that's why the

@0009@0010@015D@000C@0010@FFFF@0009I've heard that Prince Innes of Frelia
is a fantastic tactician.@0003
Grado took Renais with no trouble, but
Frelia still has yet to fall.@0003
They say it's because Prince Innes has spies
reporting every move the empire makes.@0003
At the same time, all enemy spies in Frelia
are exposed and executed swiftly.@0003
That means that none of Frelia's secrets
are ever reported back to the empire.@0003
I've never met Prince Innes, but he doesn't
sound like a man you'd want as an enemy.@0003

hard to get where we need to go.@0003@0008@0016...@0016What do you know about that fort?@0003
It looks like it's been abandoned
for some time. Is anyone using it?@0003@000DNope. It's really run-down.
Nobody ever goes there.@0003
It's been empty for ages. I've
been inside, so I know.@0003@0008Is that right? Then what's that sound,

Three honestly be as stupid as this?@0003@000C@0016...@0016What do you mean?@0003@000ACarcino betrayed Frelia and set
a pack of mercenary dogs to kill me.@0003

It's an absurd farce.@0003
Your emperor commits horrors, and you
believe Eirika is a criminal?@0003@000C@0016...@0016What are you saying?@0003@000AYou truly are blind, aren't you?@0003
You're one of the Imperial Three, and
yet you can't see your emperor's plan?@0003@0008That's enough, Prince Innes. There's
no need to provoke him.@0003
General Glen, we've told you what we know
to be true, what we've seen firsthand.@0003
We don't want to fight you@0016...@0016@0003
But if you push us, we will drive you back
to Grado with your tail between your legs.@0003@000C@0016...@0016I see.@0003
You@0016...@0016are more observant than you know.
I am ignorant of the emperor's designs.@0003
General Duessel and I both questioned
the wisdom of this war.@0003@0002
And if you really are innocent of the
crimes attributed to you@0016...@0016@0003
Why would His Majesty lie to us?
I must know the answer.@0003@0008So, you@0016...@0016believe us?@0003@000CThe Princess Eirika I met long ago was
kind and merciful in spirit.@0003
You've faced relentless hardship, and yet
that selfsame spirit remains true.@0003@0002
@0016...@0016Let's put our fight aside for now.@0003
I will learn the truth. Then I will once
again perform the duties of my office.@0003
If you have lied to me today, I will
hound you to the very grave itself.@0003@0008Very well@0016...@0016@0003

Come, lass, listen to my words.@0003
The Great Dragon is@0016...@0016a blessing, one
that watches over all mankind.@0003
Why, in days long past, when the
Demon King appeared@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000ADemon King? Are you speaking of the

but the Great Dragon never forgets.@0003
It watches over the bones of the Demon
King in Darkling Woods.@0003
It keeps the Demon King's dark brood
from swarming the world of men.@0003

kept us safe from their blind rage.@0003@000AIs that so? I'm@0016... @0016I'm

the lands we live in as well.@0003
What does this mean?@0003@0080@0004@000BAh@0016... @0016You have seen the effects of the
omen that has appeared in the south.@0003@0002
There is an energy there that has
fouled the air and darkened the sky.@0003
The Great Dragon left Darkling Woods and
went south to investigate.@0003
We of the village wished to protect the
Great Dragon, and so I sent my grandson,@0003
Saleh, along as well.@0003
But they became embroiled in battle, and
the Great Dragon disappeared.@0003
Since that time, there's been no sign of
the Great Dragon either here or abroad.@0003
We grew worried and directed Saleh to
look for any trace of the Great Dragon.@0003
I am worried that the source of that
foul energy may be responsible.@0003@000AA foul energy@0016...@0016@0003

perhaps I can proceed more quickly.@0003

of yours!?@0003@000AHe leads a force of men against
Grado. Myrrh rides beside him.@0003@000BSaleh, this is urgent!@0003

If you're going to Grado, the swiftest
route takes you through Jehanna.@0003

join us in our journey for a time.@0003

We of the village wished to protect the
Great Dragon, and so I sent my grandson,@0003
Saleh, along as well.@0003
But they became embroiled in battle, and
the Great Dragon disappeared.@0003
Since that time, there's been no sign of
the Great Dragon either here or abroad.@0003
We grew worried and directed Saleh to
look for any trace of the Great Dragon.@0003
I am worried that the source of that
foul energy may be responsible.@0003@000AA foul energy@0016...@0016@0003
From the south?@0003
Myrrh said something
similar to this, too.@0003
Is the Great Dragon you speak
of@0016...@0016one of the Manakete?@0003@000BManakete?!?@0003
How dare you speak so
of the Great Dragon!@0003@000AI-I'm sorry.@0003@000BBut if you've seen the noble Myrrh,
perhaps I can proceed more quickly.@0003
You see, our Great Dragon took the
form of Mistress Myrrh in her travels.@0003
And you tell me that you have seen
the Great Dragon yourself, lass?@0003@000AYes. Myrrh was with my brother.@0003@000BWhat?!@0003
Where is this brother
of yours!?@0003@000AHe leads a force of men against
Grado. Myrrh rides beside him.@0003@000BI see@0016...@0016
The Great Dragon is protected.@0003
Saleh would be pleased@0016...@0016@0003

So you're safe, are you?@0003@0009@0017Yep. I took care of a whole mess

That's all right, isn't it?@0003@0017@000CI guess so@0016...@0016@0003

I bring word from Frelia!@0003@000DGo on. What news do you bring?@0003@0009Prince Innes!
You're alive and well!@0003@0002
When the reinforcements rode into Carcino,
you were nowhere to be seen@0016...@0016@0003
We thought perhaps the enemy forces
had reached you and@0016...@0016@0003
It's good to see you well, milord.@0003@000DI'm sorry to have troubled you.@0003
But remember, the duty I bear is a harsh
master. It will not let me die easily.@0003@0009Of course. Prince Innes@0016...@0016@0003@000DYes, what word do you bring
of Frelia? Speak!@0003@0009Yes, Your Highness!@0003
Frelia has invaded Carcino and engaged
the traitor Pablo's mercenary army.@0003
With aid from Elder Klimt, we are crushing
the foe where we find them.@0003
Pablo's faction is retreating ever
southward, toward Jehanna@0016...@0016@0003@000DTowards Jehanna?@0003
They must be planning to join
with the Grado forces there.@0003@000BPardon me, but I must know@0016...@0016@0003
Do you have word of my brother?@0003@0009Yes.@0003
Prince Ephraim has forced the surrender
of Grado's fortress at Rigwald.@0003
He is now marching onward toward
the imperial capital.@0003@000BToward the capital@0016...@0016@0003@000DThat fool@0016... @0016Emperor Vigarde himself and his

We're going to break through the Grado
lines and join the army of Jehanna.@0003
You should keep to the rear where it's
safe@0016...@0016@0003@000D@0080@000E@000CNo, I will stay with you.@0003
Confronting evil boldly is the sworn
duty of any ally of justice.@0003

Stone of Jehanna@0016...@0016@0003
I cannot stand by and let it
be destroyed.@0003@0009L'Arachel?@0003
Where did you come by
such information?@0003@000CHm?@0003
That@0016...@0016uh, well@0016...@0016the@0016...@0016wind
whispered to me in the night.@0003@0009The wind? Whispered to you?@0003@000CYes, that's right.
@0016...@0016And according to that gentle breeze,@0003
there are knights riding this way
from Rausten even as we speak.@0003
If we can but hold out until they arrive,
the battle will surely be ours.@0003
Come, Eirika. Let us be on our way.@0003@000C@0011@0009W-wait a moment.
L'Arachel? Who are you?@0003
# 0x0A6C
@0009@0010@013B@000C@0010@0143@000CThey should be arriving anytime now.
Are you ready, Aias?@0003@0009Mm.
Everything's in place.@0003
This Princess Eirika supposedly
defeated General Glen.@0003
I wonder@0016... @0016If it's true, then she's a
foe to be reckoned with, and no doubt.@0003
Still, there's no reason to worry.
I can best her. I know it.@0003@000CYou'll take her, I've no fear.@0003
We fought as mercenaries together,
and I know what you're capable of.@0003
I could search the continent over and
not find a man to match your skills.@0003@0009I'm honored to hear you say that.@0003
But I've no interest in the titles
and trappings of Grado's Imperial Army.@0003@000CDon't say that. You're glad you came
with me, right?@0003
You know we were both sick to death
of living like desert rats.@0003
I'm going to be a king one day.
This war is just the beginning.@0003@0009Ah@0016... @0016It starts again.@0003@000CWord has it that the Knights of Rausten
are riding from the north. They're mine.@0003
I can trust this mess to your capable
hands, can't I, Aias?@0003@0009You remember what they called me
when we were mercenaries, don't you?@0003
I was never once wounded on the
field of battle. Not once@0016...@0016@0003
My skill is not garish and loud like yours,
but I've never known defeat.@0003@000CYes, that is true.@0003
I'm depending on you, Aias.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0002

The enemy is arrayed before us.@0003
We've word that Pablo's mercenary army
is closing in from the rear.@0003
You must be cautious.@0003@0008All we have to do is hold them off
until the Knights of Rausten arrive.@0003
If we can do that, victory is as
good as ours.@0003
Let's get started,
shall we, Eirika?@0003@000AIndeed!@0003

I can't believe I've been forced
out of Carcino.@0003
It's those accursed Frelian knights
riding down on us from the north.@0003
If things don't change quickly, I'll be
forced to appeal to Grado for aid.@0003@0002
We must prove ourselves worthy allies of
Grado. We must have them in our debt!@0003
First, I'll use my magic to bury those
enemies in the distance.@0003

You lie! Where

Here are the words he spoke to me.@0003
He told me he believed I possessed

in the palace is Crown Prince Lyon?@0003@000D@0010@0122@000DWhat is there to give us pause?@0003
Should we not storm the palace and
retake it by strength of arms?@0003@000BFrelia's spy network reports that Prince
Lyon is an initiate of dark magic.@0003

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0104@000CThat is Fort Rigwald.@0003
It has stood unconquered for generations.
Its defenses are legendary.@0003
It is the jewel of Grado's fortifications,
and its walls have never been breached.@0003@0009And if we don't capture it, any attack
on the capital will be pointless.@0003
Tell me what you see, Seth.
Do we have the power to take it?@0003@000CIt's a daunting task.@0003
The enemy has the advantage of
both terrain and numbers.@0003@0009But what about in morale?@0003@000CDo you suspect the soldiers
may be unwilling to fight?@0003@0009Anything's possible.@0003
This war is a sudden thing, but Grado
and Renais had long been friendly.@0003
Before these hostilities, our nations were
allies@0016... @0016No, closer even than that.@0003
This is the emperor's war, but the hearts
of the people are not so swift to change.@0003@0002
For example, General Duessel, one of the
Imperial Three they call Obsidian@0016...@0016@0003
He was the one who taught me what I
know about fighting with the lance.@0003
Duessel's sympathies are sure to remain
with Renais@0016--@0016and with our cause.@0003
He is loyal to Grado, but he has no love
of war. I'm sure he will speak with me.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009And more than that, Prince Lyon
has been my friend for years.@0003
He can be timid at times and perhaps
was unable to oppose his father in this.@0003
But I'm sure he detests this fighting
and shares my opinions.@0003@000CPrince Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@0009There must be some Grado soldiers within
the castle who do not want to fight.@0003
If we can rush the fort and seize the
throne room, I believe they will surrender.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Optimism here may be deadly.@0003
Still, it's a far better plan than
challenging the main army face-to-face.@0003@0009Eirika is on her way to Rausten
to help end this conflict.@0003
We cannot afford to wait here
for much longer.@0003
We must take this fort and then
press on to the capital itself.@0003
Let's go!@0003

harsh. You'll burn at the stake.@0003@0009B-but@0016--@0016@0003
It's not just me! Even General
Duessel is opposed to this war!@0003@000CDuessel? You'd side with that

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@016B@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009I'm going to ask you a question. If
you've no wish to answer, remain silent.@0003

This war began on the
emperor's orders.@0003
Soldiers like me haven't the
foggiest idea what he's after.@0003@0009Then tell me this:
where is General Duessel?@0003@000CIn the capital. The general's been
opposed to this war from the start.@0003
He's been pleading with the emperor for
days now, but the emperor ignores him.@0003
They say some are questioning the
general's loyalty.@0003
He's putting his standing@0016--@0016and his life@0016--@0016
in danger by being so vocal.@0003@0009Is that so@0016...@0016@0003
Well, it appears General Duessel remains
the same true man I knew before.@0003@0015@0009What about Prince Lyon? Where's
he been through all of this?@0003
Why didn't he do anything to
temper his father's aggression?@0003@0080@0004@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0002
According to rumors@0016...@0016@0003
Emperor Vigarde was convinced to start this
war by none other than the prince himself.@0003@0080@0004@0009What did you say?@0003@0002
That's ridiculous!@0003
I know Prince Lyon well. No one
hates fighting more than he does.@0003
He would never do anything to
trigger all this bloodshed!@0003@000C@0011@000C@0010@0104@000CPrince Ephraim, please calm down.@0003@0009@0016...@0016I'm sorry.@0003

on toward the capital.@0003

find either Duessel or Lyon.@0003
I'm sure we can convince them to
join us in stopping Emperor Vigarde.@0003@000CUnderstood. But I have
misgivings, my prince.@0003
General Duessel and Prince Lyon
are both men of Grado.@0003
If we are forced into conflict
with them@0016...@0016@0003@0009It won't happen.@0003
Duessel was my teacher, and I know
he is a man of character.@0003

He, Eirika, and I are old friends.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009I understand your concerns.@0003@0002
If worse comes to worst and steel
is drawn, I will not hesitate.@0003
I'll fight and kill anyone who
thinks to oppose me.@0003@0002
Are you satisfied, Seth?@0003@000CYes@0016...@0016
I apologize for my rudeness.@0003
Your father is gone, and that
means you are king of Renais.@0003
There is no other.@0003
I just ask that you not throw
yourself into needless danger.@0003@0009I hear you.@0003
The decisions I make affect
more than my own life.@0003

It's not surprising you fell
over from that stance.@0003
Can you get up?@0003@000CSh-shut up!@0003@000ADid you hurt your knee?@0003
I know how it feels. I did it
often enough as a recruit myself.@0003
To be honest, I still do it
more than I should.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000AI'm Franz. I'm a Knight of Renais.
What's your name?@0003@000CI'm Amelia.@0003@000AAmelia, do you think I could
ask you to surrender?@0003
This may be odd, but I really
have no desire to fight you.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000AI get the feeling you don't want
to fight either. Am I right?@0003@000CI@0016...@0016@0003
B-but@0016...@0016@0003
I've heard Prince Ephraim takes female
prisoners and uses them as palace slaves.@0003
If I surrender, will I be forced to
work in the palace, too?@0003@000AN-no, don't be silly!@0003
Prince Ephraim would never do such a
thing@0016...@0016@0004I think@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou think?@0003@000ANo, he wouldn't! Of course not.

you surrender and come with me?@0003@000CWha-what are you going to do to me?!@0003@0009Calm down.@0003
As long as you don't try to stab me,

Tana, you should head back

way so I could help you!@0003@0009And yet, here I am, helping you.@0003@000CAh, well@0016... @0016Yes, that may be true, but@0016--@0016@0003
But I've been so worried about
you, Ephraim!@0003@0009I see. Oh, please don't look at me
with those teary eyes.@0003
If you're really determined to help,

anything reckless.@0003@000C@0017Ephraim@0016... @0016Thank you.@0003

I have a message from Frelia.@0003
There's been an uprising in Carcino.@0003
Pablo is leading a force of renegade
Grado supporters in rebellion.@0003@0009In Carcino@0016...@0016@0003
Any word of Eirika?
Is my sister safe?@0003@000BThe last word we received had Princess
Eirika heading to assist Prince Innes.@0003
We've not heard from her since.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Blast.@0003
I sent Eirika to Rausten thinking
it would be the safest mission.@0003
If I could, I'd pull out of here
now and go look for her but@0016...@0016@0003@000B@0011@000B@0010@0104@000BPrince Ephraim.@0003@0009@0016...@0016I know, I know. I mustn't let my
emotions dictate my actions.@0003@0002
If Carcino has allied itself with Grado,
then defeating Grado is our best bet.@0003
We proceed as planned. Tell them that.@0003@000BUnderstood.@0003@000B@0011@000B@0011@0009Be careful, Eirika.@0003

@0009@0010@0114@0009@0016...@0016What?!@0003@0002
Was that an earthquake?@0003
I think it's passed.@0003@000B@0010@0104@000BPrince Ephraim.@0003@0009I'm fine. There's nothing to worry about.@0003
I was surprised, that's all. You're not
shaken in the slightest, are you?@0003@000BActually, it surprised me as well.@0003
I'd heard that tremors such as those
were commonplace in Grado.@0003
Apparently, they are usually weak and
cause little, if any, damage.@0003@0009Now that you mention it, I remember a
while back, when I was first in Grado.@0003
Eirika and I were startled by a
tremor just like that one.@0003
Lyon said he had grown used to them,
and he just laughed.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0009We don't have any time to tend
to injuries just now.@0003
We must press forward. We must

order to engage them.@0003@0009Hm@0016... @0016Prince Ephraim leads
the enemy forces, doesn't he?@0003@000CThat is correct.
Prince Ephraim of Renais.@0003@0009Bah@0016...@0016@0003@000CRenais is our enemy.@0003
General, please give the order to attack.@0003@0009No. Order all units to hold.
Do not initiate the attack.@0003
I want to speak with Ephraim first.@0003@0080@0004@000C@0016......@0016@0003
So it's true.@0003
You plan to betray the empire and
ally yourself with the enemy.@0003@0009What?!@0003@0080@0004@000CGeneral Duessel, you stand accused
of treason of the highest order.@0003
Lay down your weapons, and follow
my commands.@0003
If you fail to do so, if you resist in
any way, I will execute you on the spot.@0003@0009This is nonsense!@0003
Who is behind this madness!@0003@000CThese are His Majesty's orders.@0003
The emperor has anticipated
your treachery.@0003@0002
Prepare yourself.@0003@0009Impossible@0016... @0016His Majesty?@0003

@0009@0010@013F@000B@0010@0113@0009Cormag, you and I will
bring that traitor down.@0003
Go around that fort to the southeast
and drive into them from the sea.@0003@000BWe're fighting General Duessel?@0003
But he's one of the cornerstones
of the empire. How could@0016--@0016@0003
He's been like a father to you
and to my brother.@0003
Do you truly mean to kill him?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
If that is what my emperor commands,
then yes. Without hesitation.@0003
Cormag, if you are a true knight
of Grado, you will do the same.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003

Grado army is before us.@0003@0009I know, but something's odd.@0003
They're chasing someone down.
Is that a deserter?@0003@0002

What do you want?@0003@000BAh, Selena. You're to return to the
capital immediately.@0003
Duessel is no longer your concern.@0003
His Majesty has declared you untrustworthy.
I've been sent to relieve you of command.@0003@0009What?@0003@000BYou've proven yourself incapable of dealing
with a single old man@0016...@0016@0003

Now then, Beran.@0003@000D@0010@013E@000DYes, sir.@0003@000BI'm leaving.@0003

bidding has CHANGED.@0003
You, Selena, are not to be trusted.
These are His Majesty's words.@0003
You share the same sentiments as Duessel.
You could turn traitor, just as he has.@0003
You should feel honored. He could have
ordered me to kill you where you stand.@0003@0009Th-that's absurd!@0003
His Majesty, he@0016...@0016@0003
He knows I am trustworthy.@0003@000BThen return to the capital

You've grown to be quite
the impressive commander.@0003
I remember what a stubborn young
lad you were when I taught you.@0003@000AAny skill I have, I owe
to you, Duessel.@0003
I'm curious, why are you being
pursued by your own troops?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0080@0004@000ASpeak to me, Duessel.@0003
I want to put an end to this war.@0003
I'm sure you feel the same way.@0003@0080@0004@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0016...@0016As you know, the emperor
was once a man of compassion.@0003
He loathed war, and he worked to
build peace across all nations.@0003
Then@0016...@0016one day that all changed.@0003@000A@0016......@0016@0003
But why? Why did he change?
What happened?@0003@000CI wish I knew.@0003
But if you're looking for a
likely cause, I have one.@0003
This all seems to have begun
when Prince Lyon and the mages@0003
created a strange gemstone they
referred to as the Dark Stone.@0003@000AThe Dark Stone?@0003@000CThat's what the clerics and the prince
called it, at any rate.@0003
Now, I'm just a soldier. I don't know
anything about these magic things.@0003
But they said the Dark Stone is more
powerful even than the Sacred Stones.@0003@000AAnd the Sacred Stones had the power
to defeat the Demon King.@0003
If the Dark Stone is stronger than
they are@0016...@0016@0003@0008@0016...@0016Ephraim.@0003@000AWhat is it, Myrrh?@0003@0008The wave of evil I felt
surging from the capital@0016...@0016@0003
It hungers@0016... @0016It consumes.
It envelops and transforms.@0003
This power can tarnish the purest
of souls with its corruption.@0003@000AAre you saying this Dark Stone is
responsible for the change in Vigarde?@0003
The timing fits, doesn't it? The
stone is created, and then@0016--@0016@0003
Duessel, where is the Dark Stone now?@0003@000CIt's in the capital, with Prince Lyon.@0003
He's been carrying it with him ever
since the day it was created.@0003@000AUnderstood. Duessel, I'm going
to the capital.@0003
I must talk to Lyon. Maybe we
can restore the emperor together.@0003@000C@0016...@0016I'm going with you.@0003@000ABut we'll be fighting Grado's
army@0016--@0016your own men.@0003@000CI appreciate your concern, but I've
already been branded a traitor.@0003
Prince Ephraim, if you mean to
save my lord the emperor@0016...@0016@0003
If you hope to restore him to
his former self@0016...@0016@0003

Come, Dozla, we must find a ship.@0003@000B@0011@000D@0017Gwah ha ha! Sounds fun!
Come on, Rennac!@0003@0017@000D@0011@000D@0010@0124@000DHonestly, L'Arachel, do you even
think before you set these plans?@0003
Oh, please@0016... @0016Someone end
my misery!@0003@000D@0011@0009@0016...@0016What was all that about?@0003

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0104@000CPrince Ephraim, our
ship has arrived.@0003
Let us prepare to board.
@0016...@0016Something troubling you?@0003@0009No@0016... @0016It's nothing.@0003@0002
All right. Here we go!@0003

What's going on?@0003
Wait, we can talk later. Let's get
you to safety first.@0003
Come with us, Duessel.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009Duessel!@0003@000CI am General Duessel, the Obsidian,
of the Imperial Three@0016...@0016@0003
This name and my service to His Majesty
have been my life's blood.@0003
As of this moment it is all gone.
I've no reason to continue@0016...@0016@0003@0009Duessel@0016...@0016@0003
Enough of this rubbish!@0003
You are my mentor! I will
not let you die!@0003@000C@0016...@0016Prince Ephraim.@0003@0009I know about the
emperor's madness.@0003
How will your death serve
Grado? Who will it help?@0003
What of your country? Its
people? Its future!?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009You will live, Duessel.@0003
As a traitor@0016...@0016
In disgrace@0016...@0016@0003
I know that for a man such as you
this is more agonizing than death.@0003
But you will live nonetheless. You
will live for something more important.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
I understand.@0003
This old fool's
life is yours.@0003
# 0x0AC8
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0113@0009Is that you, Cormag?@0003@000CSir Duessel@0016...@0016@0003
You have abandoned your country and
your lord. I must take your life.@0003@0009I know. I'm ready now.@0003
I have no duty anymore. But you, Cormag.
You're a soldier of the empire.@0003
Follow your orders and fulfill your
mission. I'm ready.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009Cormag!@0003@000CTo be honest, I'm confused.@0003
Must you truly die? Is your
crime really deserving of death?@0003
I know my brother could have
settled this, but@0016...@0016@0003
I've come here to stop you, and
yet I find that I cannot.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CYou see, I couldn't believe you
would ever truly turn traitor.@0003
And now I stand here, looking at
you, Duessel of the Imperial Three.@0003
And you do not have the eyes of
a traitor.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CNo. I cannot turn my lance on
you, the empire's faithful son.@0003
General Duessel@0016...@0016@0003
Until this matter is sorted, you
travel under my protection.@0003@0009Cormag@0016...@0016@0003
Forgive me@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0AC9
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0113@0009Wait.@0003
Please stop fighting.@0003
I'm sure we can reach an
agreement if we just talk.@0003@000CYou are@0016...?@0016@0003@0009My name is Tana. You're from
Grado, aren't you?@0003
Why are you fighting
against General Duessel?@0003@000CThat's none of your@0016--@0016@0003@0009Do you hate him?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Do I hate him? This isn't some petty
schoolyard squabble, girl.@0003
I'm a soldier of the empire, and
I have my orders.@0003
I've been sent to punish a traitor,
and that's what I aim to do.@0003@0009Are you telling me that
General Duessel's a traitor?@0003
Don't you know him? Do you
think that's really true?@0003@000CWhat I think isn't at question.
Faith does not dictate my actions.@0003
I have my orders.@0003@0009Ephraim trusts your General Duessel.
He's given him the benefit of the doubt.@0003
Have you chosen not to believe the
reasons for his actions?@0003@000CGet out of my way!@0003
I'll waste no more time
with this duel of words!@0003@0009Wait!
Please@0016...@0016@0003
Protect General Duessel.@0003
It would be tragic if he died
before his motives became clear.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Move, please.@0003
If you won't get out of the way,
I'll have to move you by force.@0003@0009Very well. If you must.@0003
But in exchange, I'm asking you
to believe General Duessel.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@0016...@0016You're an odd bird.@0003
To think I'd lose a fight not to a
man's sword but to a woman's words@0016...@0016@0003@0009What?@0003@000CYou win.
I will protect General Duessel.@0003
But I plan on sorting this whole
mess out with the general himself.@0003@0009Do you mean that?@0003@000CI don't know if this is the
right thing to do or not.@0003
But I think this is what my
brother would have done.@0003

blanketed in a thick fog.@0003

hard years when I was still sailing.@0003

It was that Valter@0016...@0016@0003@000ASelena. Duessel has betrayed us.

From the east@0016...@0016@0003@000E@0080@000A@000A@0016...@0016That won't do, Seth.@0003
I cannot approve of sending
reservists to the front lines.@0003@000CBut@0016...@0016the Grado army outnumbers our own by a
tremendous amount.@0003
We have talented soldiers, but that counts
for nothing against those numbers.@0003
Currently, we have some ready reservists
in the rear, protecting our supply convoy.@0003
What good is defending our convoy if it
comes at the cost of losing the front?@0003
We must abandon our rear guard and
strengthen the van, or we've already lost.@0003@000AThis is enemy territory. We
cannot surrender the convoy!@0003@000CBut, Prince Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@000ASeth, I know you only want to improve
the odds of our success.@0003
And I know you make these suggestions
in part to protect me from harm.@0003
However, I have no intention of
changing my mind in this. I@0016--@0016@0003@0002

@000A@0010@0114@0008@0010@0104@000C@0010@016A@000CPrince Ephraim! It's a trap!@0003
The city's crawling with Grado
men! We're under attack!@0003@0008Prince Ephraim.@0003@000AAll troops prepare to fight! To arms!@0003
# 0x0AE0
@000C@0010@0143@000CSoldiers of Grado! You call yourself
warriors? You're pathetic!@0003
Fort Rigwald? You lost it! Your
General Duessel? A traitor!@0003
Where is the honor of the Grado Imperial
Army? It wallows in filth and mud!@0003
Is this the ending you envisioned?
Is this how you would be remembered?@0003
Will you let the bards sing of how
you fell to the renegade Ephraim?@0003@0002
I think not!@0003
Now get up and fight!
Kill them all!@0003
And bring me Ephraim's head!@0003
# 0x0AE1
@0009@0010@0143@000C@0010@0148@000C@0017Heh heh heh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Caellach. Interesting.
What are you doing here?@0003
You were ordered to loose your dogs
of war on Jehanna, were you not?@0003@0009Keep silent, you decrepit sod.
I told you, Jehanna's under control.@0003
My plan is in full effect.
All we need do now is wait.@0003
You see, Jehanna is an overripe fruit.@0003
It's being devoured by worms from within.
We can pluck it anytime we wish.@0003@000C@0017Heh heh heh@0016... @0016@0017Oh, how your
plans seem to have gone awry.@0003
Even now, Eirika makes her
way toward Jehanna.@0003
Your perfect fruit has turned
to rot while you did nothing.@0003
It's time. You will return to
the capital with me.@0003@0009What?! Are you truly
serious, you old goat?@0003
Glen@0016...@0016@0003
No, it's that black-hearted Valter@0016...@0016
What's he playing at now?@0003@000CThere's no call for that sort of talk.
That one has his uses after all.@0003
You can leave the defeat of Ephraim
to your subordinates.@0003
Oh yes, and you can use the troops
I brought with me as well.@0003
It will, no doubt, be an interesting battle.
@0017Heh heh heh@0016...@0016@0003@0002
@0017Let's go now, Caellach.@0003
You wouldn't want to hurt a certain
someone's feelings, would you?@0003@0009Bah.
What else can I do?@0003
# 0x0AE2
@000C@0010@0114@000CMore of those fiends?@0003
What's going on?
Their movements@0016...@0016@0003
It's@0016... @0016It's as though those creatures
are cooperating with Grado's army@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0AE3
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0104@000CThe enemy troops have been defeated.
We're taking care of the wounded now.@0003@0009Understood. We'll rest in this city until
we're prepared to advance.@0003
Replenish supplies and rest the troops.@0003
Remind every soldier that anyone who breaks
the city's laws will be severely punished.@0003
Anything else?@0003@000CWe should prepare defenses along
the east in case of assault.@0003
The capital's not far, and fresh
troops could be here at any time.@0003@0009Good point. All right, set up
three rotating watches. Then@0016--@0016@0003
# 0x0AE4

# 0x0AE5
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0104@0009Myrrh's gone?
Are you sure?@0003@000CYes, she's been missing since this morning.@0003
There are no signs of a struggle.
I feel she left of her own accord.@0003@0009Where did she go? Didn't
anyone see her?@0003@000COne of the guards reports having seen
a young lady heading east.@0003
He said she seemed unsteady on her
feet. It may have been her.@0003@0009Prepare to move out.
We head east.@0003@000CPrince Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@0080@0004@0009I'm not just acting on emotion, Seth.
The capital lies to the east as well.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009Seth, you will obey your commander
and sovereign, do you hear me?@0003
Listen, I know what you said is
true. I am king in all but title now.@0003
I know I must place my duty as
commander above my life as a man.@0003
And once I am crowned, I most
certainly will do exactly that.@0003
However, I am not ready to divorce
myself from my compassion just yet.@0003
I will find the balance somehow, the
means to save my country and her people.@0003@0002
That is the king I wish to become,
and so that is the man I must be.@0003
I need your help in this, Seth.@0003@000C@0016...@0016I understand, Prince Ephraim.@0003
If that is your decision, then I
will do my best to assist you.@0003@0009I'm counting on it.@0003@0015@0009Please be safe, Myrrh.@0003

Looks like we lost.@0003@000E@0080@000A@0008@0080@000A@0008@0017Ah, Marisa! I found you!@0003@0017@000CEwan?@0003
What are you doing here?@0003@0008@0080@000B@0009Marisa, the mercenary guild sent
you here, didn't they?@0003
They assigned you to fight
under Commander Gerik, right?@0003@000CThat's right.@0003
But the chief's not here.@0003@0009@0017I know! It was all a mistake.@0003
Your commander's over there,
working on another job.@0003
He wants you to join him.@0003@0017@000C@0017Really?@0003
He said that?@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009Yep.@0003@000CI'm on my way.@0003@0009Hey, wait! Wait!

training to be a sage.@0003
I need to find a woman by the name of
Marisa. I don't know where she's gone.@0003
If you'll help me find her, I'll gladly
travel with you.@0003
I'm a useful guy to know. In a pinch,
I can use the magic I've learned so far.@0003
So what do you say? Do we have a deal?@0003@0017
# 0x0AE9
@0009@0010@015C@000C@0010@FFFF@0009Ah@0016... @0016I wonder if that dancer
will ever come this way again.@0003
I don't know why, but her dances
really pepped me up.@0003
Even after a hard day's work, I felt
as fresh as if I'd just woken up!@0003
It sure would be nice if she would
dance for me again someday.@0003
# 0x0AEA
@0009@0010@013F@000F@0010@0126@0009So this is a dragonstone@0016...@0016@0003
The description was accurate. It
looks like an ordinary gemstone.@0003@0002
If only His Majesty hadn't ordered me to
bring this to the capital immediately@0016...@0016@0003
I've heard reports that Prince Ephraim
and a Frelian army have landed nearby.@0003
If I didn't have those blasted
restrictive orders, I could@0016--@0016@0003@000F@0016...@0016Return it@0016...@0016@0003@0009What?@0003@000F@0080@000E@000CThe stone@0016... @0016Please.
Return it to me.@0003@0009You@0016... @0016You're@0016--@0016@0003@0080@0004@000CReturn the stone to me@0016...@0016
Please@0016...@0016I'll do anything.@0003@0009Why do you want the stone?@0003
Who are you? You're not from
Grado, that's for sure.@0003@000CWithout the stone, I@0016...@0016@0003
Please, give it back to me.@0003@0009Answer my questions!@0003@000CMy name is Myrrh. I come from
Darkling Woods.@0003
I was betrayed, and my stone
was taken from me.@0003
I was imprisoned, caged, to be
transported somewhere.@0003
Prince Ephraim came to my rescue.@0003
I've been traveling in his care
ever since.@0003@0009You're with Ephraim?@0003
I can't let you leave. Maybe I should
take you back to the capital with me.@0003@000CWait@0016...@0016@0003
You're from Grado?@0003
Tell me, has anyone around you@0016--@0016@0003
Have you noticed any changes in
the people around you recently?@0003@0009Changes?@0003
What do you mean by that?@0003@000CAnyone near you@0016...@0016@0003
Has anyone been transformed,
either in spirit or demeanor?@0003
Does anyone act in such a way as to
appear a different person altogether?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
How could you know@0016...@0016@0003@000CThe darkness is to blame.@0003
I've come here to stop it.@0003@0009@0016...@0016You will tell me more.@0003
If I find you are lying, I will
punish you. Do you understand?@0003@000CYes. Are you ready?@0003
I will tell you
everything I know.@0003

Myrrh, I think I understand
everything you've told me.@0003@000CGood.@0003@0009But I cannot believe it.@0003
How can I allow myself to believe
it? If it's true, then@0016...@0016@0003
then His Majesty is already@0016--@0016@0003@000C@0080@000D@000BDame Selena@0016...@0016@0003
What's that?@0003@0080@0004@0009It is a fluorspar@0016...@0016@0003
His Majesty presented it to me
when I was promoted to general.@0003
This gemstone is proof of my commission.
It's one of Grado's treasures@0016...@0016@0003
I received it years ago, but I remember
that day like it was yesterday.@0003
His Majesty smiled so kindly. His voice
was filled with dignity and affection@0016...@0016@0003@000BDame Selena, you love
your emperor, don't you?@0003@0009What are you@0016--@0016@0003@000BI can see it.@0003
Dame Selena, I can see
how much you treasure@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@001D@0009@0080@001C@0009@0016......@0016@0003
His Majesty is most compassionate.@0003@0002
You see, I'm a commoner. I was raised in
a desolate, impoverished village.@0003
My family couldn't afford our taxes.
No one could. We were desperate.@0003
Some of us considered@0016...@0016horrible things
to make enough money to survive winter.@0003
Then, supplies began to arrive. We were
told they came from the emperor himself.@0003
He sent them to us, a poor frontier town
who couldn't even afford to pay taxes.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0009Neighboring kingdoms must have thought
the emperor mad, I can only guess.@0003
But His Majesty did not care about
his standing among kings.@0003
He cared for his people. He saved us.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0009That spring, I went to the capital
and became a soldier, then a knight.@0003
I wanted to dedicate my life to the
emperor who had saved it.@0003
I felt I understood his dream.
I felt I shared his vision@0016...@0016@0003@000BDame Selena@0016...@0016@0003@0009Myrrh, this wave of dark
energy you spoke of@0016...@0016@0003
Can its evil really change
a person that completely?@0003@000BYes@0016...@0016@0003
All trace of this person would
be consumed@0016...@0016destroyed.@0003@0009How can the process be reversed?@0003@000B@0016...@0016I'm sorry.@0003
That is@0016...@0016impossible.@0003@0009@0080@001D@0005@0009@0080@001C@0009@0016...@0016I see.@0003@000D@0010@016B@0080@0004@000DDame Selena.
Enemy troops are heading this way!@0003
We await your orders.@0003@0009Understood. Tell the men
we meet them head on.@0003@0015@000D@0011@0009Myrrh. I release you.@0003
Return to Prince Ephraim's side.@0003@000BDame Selena@0016...@0016@0003@0009I apologize, but I cannot return
your dragonstone to you.@0003
I vowed never again to fail in
my duty to His Majesty.@0003
If you want the dragonstone back,
tell Ephraim he must defeat me.@0003@000BBut that's@0016--@0016@0003@0009Go now! This place
will soon run red!@0003

General Selena possessed
a curious stone.@0003
Myrrh, is this the
dragonstone you lost?@0003@000CYes, it is.@0003
But I'm saddened by its return.@0003
My dragonstone is here and yet@0016...@0016@0003
My heart is heavy with remorse@0016...@0016@0003@0009Myrrh@0016...@0016@0003@000CEphraim, can you tell me
why this had to happen?@0003
Dame Selena was a good person.@0003
She was filled with joy when
she spoke of the emperor.@0003
Why did Dame Selena
have to die?@0003
Why did we have to take
up arms against her?@0003@0009I'm sorry@0016...@0016@0003
If I could have convinced her to
lay down her arms, I would have.@0003
It was simply not possible. I had
no choice. She had to die.@0003
I know you don't approve, but you
must know I have my reasons.@0003@000CMy apologies@0016...@0016@0003
Ephraim, I@0016...@0016
I am not seeking to blame you.@0003
It's just that@0016...@0016I grieve for her.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CI ventured out of the forest,
chasing after that dark energy.@0003
I thought perhaps that I could
negate its evil force.@0003
Is your cause so different from
Selena's?@0003
How many good people must die
alongside the wicked?@0003@0009Myrrh@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat can we do to end this without
any more good people dying?@0003@0009I don't have any answer for you.@0003
But I will continue on toward the capital,
and perhaps I will find one there.@0003
I will learn the truth behind this madness.@0003
# 0x0AF3
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@013F@0009Are you Selena?@0003@000CIndeed I am. And you
are Prince Ephraim.@0003@0009I know you've spoken with Myrrh.@0003
Withdraw your troops. You must
know the emperor is not rational!@0003@000CYes, I know.@0003@0009Then why? Why do we still fight?@0003@000CI am a general of the empire.
His Majesty's word is law.@0003@0009That's ridiculous. You know the emperor is
deranged, and yet you follow his orders?!@0003
Is that truly loyalty?!@0003@000CPrince Ephraim, you cannot understand.@0003
I know the path I'm given is foolish.
Yet I am a knight, and I have no other.@0003@0009Selena, please!@0003
Surrender! I have no wish
to see you die here!@0003@000CMe? Die?@0003
Prince Ephraim, you misunderstand me.
I have no intention of dying.@0003
Madness though it may be, I will be
the one doing the killing today.@0003
# 0x0AF4
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@013F@0009Well met, Selena.@0003@000CGeneral Duessel@0016...@0016@0003
I must offer you my apologies.@0003
I called you a traitor, but
I was mistaken.@0003
Your loyalty never wavered,
not for an instant.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CAnd yet you must know that I have
no intention of withdrawing.@0003
So let us not waste words. Let us
settle this with steel, my friend.@0003@0009That's how it is to be, then? One
of us dies by the other's hands?@0003@000CYes. It's the path
I've chosen.@0003
I have no regrets.@0003@0009I see@0016...@0016@0003
Well. I, too, must follow
the path that I have chosen.@0003@000CVery well.@0003
# 0x0AF5
@000A@0010@0114@000C@0010@011B@000CAre you Ephraim?@0003@000AYes, I am, but@0016...@0016@0003@000CI'm Gerik, mercenary commander.@0003@0002
Prince Innes bought our swords
and sent us here to join you.@0003
Any problem with that?@0003@000AInnes sent you?@0003@000CYeah, and the prince had a
message for you as well.@0003
He said, I've no need of assistance,
Ephraim, but I'm sure you do.@0003
That's all. I figured you would
know what he was talking about.@0003@000AWell, that's definitely from Innes.@0003
Regardless, your aid is welcome.
Please join us in our fight.@0003
# 0x0AF6
@000C@0010@011B@0009@0010@011E@0009Chief.@0003@000COh, Marisa!
So Ewan found you after all, eh?@0003
Sorry for the trouble. Appears
the guild made an error.@0003
Blast it all. I should have 
double-checked everything myself.@0003@0009No worries.@0003
I'm with you now.@0003@000CHave you taken any wounds?@0003
They sent you all the way to Taizel,
after all. What ill luck that was@0016...@0016@0003@0009I'm fine.@0003
I'll fight at your side.@0003@000CAh, that's comforting. We've been hired
to guard a Prince Ephraim.@0003
Before we do, though, we'd better take
care of these enemy troops, huh?@0003
Let's move, Marisa.@0003@0009Understood.@0003
# 0x0AF7
@000C@0010@011C@0009@0010@0121@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Ah! Sister!@0003@0017@000CEwan, you've completed the task
you were given, haven't you?@0003
This is a dangerous place. Please,
go wait at the inn.@0003
I'll be there to collect you
as soon as I'm able.@0003@0009No way! I want to fight, too.@0003
I've become friends with
Prince Ephraim, you know?@0003
We're going to take out the
big, bad evil empire.@0003@0009@0011@000CWait just a minute, Ewan!@0003
Ah! Ooh, that troublemaker.@0003
# 0x0AF8
@0009@0010@0160@000C@0010@FFFF@0009You must have gone through
a lot to make it here.@0003
Did you come to warn us
about the fighting going on?@0003
Thanks so much.@0003
Here, please take this staff.
Oh, go on. Don't be shy.@0003
# 0x0AF9
@0009@0010@0162@000C@0010@FFFF@0009Dame Selena often visits our
village when she's on patrol.@0003
She even came to our aid when
we were attacked by bandits.@0003
@0016......@0016@0003
Please, I beg of you. Don't
hurt Dame Selena.@0003
# 0x0AFA
@000C@0010@0114@000CThe Grado capital@0016...@0016@0003@0002
It looks like it hasn't changed at
all since the last time I was here.@0003
Eirika and I came here once long
ago with our father.@0003
Duessel taught me the lance, and
I studied history with Lyon.@0003@0002
I never imagined I'd come back
here armed for battle.@0003
# 0x0AFB
@0009@0010@012E@000C@0010@0150@000C@0016...@0016And so the hero Grado and his companions
used the five Sacred Stones to seal away@0003
the evil of the Demon King, and his wicked
soul was locked within the Stone of Grado.@0003
The Stone of Grado came to be known
as the Fire Emblem.@0003
To this day, it's kept safe and honored
as a national treasure of the empire.@0003
@0016...@0016I think that's about it.@0003@0002
For more on Grado's life, read Founding
Emperor Grado. It's comprehensive.@0003@0009@0016...@0016It's so thick.@0003
@0016...@0016And the letters are so small.@0003@000CBut you have to read it. You don't want
Father MacGregor to discipline you again.@0003@0009@0016...@0016I'm no good with books.@0003
The problem is they don't move.
I get bored silly.@0003
I understand so much better when
you explain it to me, Lyon.@0003@000CYes, but@0016...@0016it's kind of weird to
be helping you all the time.@0003@0002
It's just that I admire you, Ephraim.@0003
I want to be strong, like you@0016--@0016brave
and handsome@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I've got an idea. Why don't you teach
me to wield a lance, Ephraim?@0003
I can't let my defeat to Eirika go
unchallenged. I look foolish.@0003@0009It's a deal.
We practice tomorrow, though.@0003
If you want to beat Eirika, you
have to take this seriously.@0003@000CJust go easy on me, all right?@0003

They happen a lot, don't they?@0003@0015@000C@0080@000D@000BAre you all right, Myrrh?@0003@0008Yes, I was startled.@0003
Ephraim, this place@0016...@0016
Did it always shake like this?@0003@000BYeah, Grado's been prone to
earthquakes for a long time.@0003
Tiny tremors like that happen
all the time. Don't worry.@0003@0008Really?@0003
Um, Ephraim?@0003@0008@0080@000B@000BWhat is it?@0003@0009I can feel it@0016--@0016from inside the
castle, I can feel the darkness.@0003
I feel a broad pool of darkness
deep within its walls.@0003@000BPerhaps it's coming from the
throne room.@0003
That's where Emperor Vigarde,
the man who started this, is.@0003
Let's go.@0003

@0017@0080@0004Let me tell you something, Ephraim.@0003
I've been waiting for this moment
for a very, very long time.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009I will make the world Grado's@0016--@0016
No, MY plaything.@0003
I've been planning this my whole life.
Why else would I befriend you and Eirika?@0003@0002
I needed to learn where and how to
attack and destroy Renais@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Thanks to the two of you, I learned
all I needed to know.@0003
While you feigned compassion for my
weakness and scorned me in your hearts.@0003@0017@000CWhat?!
Lyon@0016...@0016@0003
You're wrong. We never@0016--@0016@0003@0009And then my chance arrived.@0003
I replaced my useless father, readied
my tools, and set my plan in motion.@0003
I began by destroying Renais@0016...@0016
And then I murdered your father.@0003@000CYou@0016...@0016@0003
You lie, Lyon!
You could never@0016--@0016@0003@0009@0017Shall I tell you a story? Would you like
to hear of your father's last moments?@0003
You'll laugh really. Your father's such
a weakling, and yet he tried so hard@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CLyon!@0003
No more insults to my father,
or I may forget myself!@0003@0009@0017Oh, are you angry, Ephraim?@0003
But, not even you can stop me now.@0003@0002
The Stones of Frelia and Renais are dust,
and Jehanna's is soon to follow@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016Which leaves only two more@0016...@0016@0003

I shall see my dream fulfilled@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CWhat?!@0003@0009Ephraim, you are in my way.
Therefore@0016...@0016@0003

@0016...@0016How bothersome.@0003
I truly do wish to be your opponent,
but I'm not yet at full strength.@0003
Let's meet again, shall we?
Assuming you live, of course.@0003@0002

@000D@0010@0104@000B@0010@0114@000E@0010@0129@001C@000EWho is it?@0003@000DAh!@0003@000E@0080@000A@0008Has my execution been
moved up on the schedule?@0003
Wait. You're not a Grado
soldier. Who are you?@0003@000BI am Ephraim of Renais.
And who are you?@0003@0008That's an odd question for an
executioner. My name is Knoll.@0003
Until recently, I was one of Grado's
top researchers in arcane matters.@0003@000DSo why is it you are locked up here?@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003@000BYou need not answer if you do not wish to.
Tell me, what is Lyon attempting to do?@0003
I still have things I intend to ask him.@0003@0008You wish to speak to Prince Lyon?@0003
You really don't know anything,
do you?@0003@000BWhat do you mean?@0003
Is there something wrong with
Lyon? What do you know?@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003
I'll tell you all I know, if
you would like.@0003
However, I think you will not
thank me once you hear it.@0003@0015@0008It all began one year ago@0016...@0016
That was when the emperor died.@0003
The emperor's health worsened,
and then he@0016...@0016@0003@000BHold.
What are you about?@0003
One year ago? That's before Grado's
invasion of Renais began.@0003
And I just saw the emperor.
I killed him with my own hands.@0003@0008Allow me to continue in the order
in which everything occurred.@0003
One year ago, the emperor died of
the illness that had plagued him.@0003
Prince Lyon was devastated. He
fell into an endless despair.@0003
He felt unworthy to take the throne,
unable to rule without his father.@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003@0008He then began to look for a way to
overturn his father's demise.@0003
He wanted to resurrect him@0016--@0016@0003@000BWait, resurrect him?@0003@0008Yes.@0003
As you know, the Stone of Grado is
possessed of@0016...@0016unique powers.@0003
It was once used to seal away the Demon
King, and it alone held the dark one's soul.@0003
It burned within with the Demon King's
rage, and we called it the Fire Emblem.@0003@0002
Prince Lyon and a team of mages skilled in

I remember the joy in Prince Lyon's eyes
when he spoke of using it to save lives.@0003@000BLyon@0016...@0016@0003@0008Prince Lyon told us he intended to use
the Fire Emblem to restore the emperor.@0003
His death had been kept from the public,
but rumors were beginning to fly.@0003
We knew we had to hurry, before the people
learned the truth of the emperor's death.@0003
Prince Lyon dedicated himself to research,
skipping meals, foregoing sleep@0016...@0016@0003
And then@0016...@0016@0003@000BWhat happened?@0003@0008I wasn't there, so I did not
witness it firsthand.@0003
By the time I arrived, the
deed had already been done.@0003@0002
The Fire Emblem had been
shattered, split in two.@0003
One was a Sacred Stone,
and the other@0016...@0016@0003

Prince Lyon, what miracle
is this? It cannot be!@0003
What@0016--? @0016What is that stone?@0003@0008This? This is the Dark Stone. It bears
even more power than any Sacred Stone.@0003
I extracted and condensed all of the
magic bound within the Fire Emblem.@0003
The Dark Stone's power is what gave
my father back the spark of life.@0003@000CThe Dark Stone@0016...?@0016@0003@0008Now that the Dark Stone is mine, I

Father MacGregor grew concerned with
Prince Lyon's health.@0003
He tried several times to dissuade him

Prince Lyon executed him personally.@0003@0002
I, too, was branded a traitor and arrested.

What is this place?@0003@0009This is the former resting place of
the Stone of Grado, the Fire Emblem.@0003
We've kept the Sacred Twins of Grado
here as well.@0003
If we're still lucky, they may still
be here.@0003@000CThe Sacred Twins@0016...@0016@0003
Those are the ancient weapons once
wielded by the founders of our nations.@0003
Let's see if I remember my studies@0016...@0016@0003
Emperor Grado's were the magic tome
Gleipnir and Garm, the black axe.@0003@0009That is correct.

They're supposed to be the most
powerful of Grado's imperial generals.@0003
For them to have abandoned the capital
and lead the battle into Jehanna@0016...@0016@0003@0009The Knights of Rausten have ridden to
the eastern front to aid Frelia, but@0003
the enemy attacks have been brutal.
I fear for their survival.@0003@000BWe march for Jehanna immediately!
We will rescue Eirika.@0003@0009B-but even if we leave now, we
will not make it in time@0016...@0016@0003@000BWe'll make it. Rest easy on that.@0003@0002
Eirika is my sister. That one will

and pillaged your way across the land@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat?@0003@0009H-hold on! Calm down! You won't
get any treasure by killing me.@0003

cost you. 10,000 gold.@0003@000C10,000 gold?@0003@0009Yeah@0016...@0016
Is that too high?@0003
Fine, then you get my sword

So that's me and the treasure for
only 9,980 gold! What do you say?@0003@000CYou know, I have no idea how I
got pulled into this conversation.@0003

I'd better get to Eirika and the
others as soon as possible.@0003@000C@0010@0104@000CI've discovered which of Grado's generals
lead the forces surrounding the hall.@0003
Valter the Moonstone and
Caellach the Tiger Eye.@0003
Two of the strongest of the empire's
generals, with near-peerless forces.@0003
Above all else, we must rescue Princess
Eirika, and yet@0016...@0016@0003
If you fall, Prince Ephraim, we're all
finished. And this accursed sand@0016...@0016@0003

Some of us can move better than
others, though@0016...@0016@0003
A combination of magic wielders and sky
riders should give us some advantage.@0003
Whatever we do, we must move cautiously.@0003@0009I understand. This is just
like the battle for Renvall.@0003
We either rescue Eirika or
defeat all the enemy troops.@0003

now that he's gone, I miss the lad.@0003
I don't know where he's at or what
he's doing, but@0016...@0016@0003@0009Do you miss that life? Do you ever want
to be a mercenary again, to see him?@0003@000CNope. The time we worked together was
fun and all, but@0016... @0016No.@0003
I don't want to end up another no-name
mercenary lying dead in a ditch.@0003
I'd rather serve the Grado Empire

I'm going to see how far my axe will
take me. And then, one day@0016...@0016@0003@0009One day, you'll kill me and be

time, there's no escape.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0114@000CEscape?
I'm not going anywhere.@0003
I came here for you.
I came to defeat you.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0142@0009What's this?@0003
A scurrying little mouse
that roars like a lion?@0003
Are you saying this time
will be different than last?@0003
Will you finally provide me
with some amusement?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0114@000CI'll do far more than that.@0003
I'll provide you with a messy
end to your sorry life.@0003@000C@0011
# 0x0B1F
@0009@0010@0142@0009What now, Cormag?@0003
Have you betrayed your
oaths and your emperor?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000CI have.@0003
I can no longer serve Grado.@0003
But I must know the truth,
Valter, and you will tell me.@0003
You're the one who murdered
my brother, aren't you?@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0142@0009@0016...@0016Hmph.@0003
No reason for lies, seeing as
you're nothing but a traitor.@0003
You're right, Cormag!@0003
I was the one who cut your
brother down.@0003
He was just like you, a
weak, pitiful fool.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0002

I've dreamt of revenge,
chased it for days@0016...@0016@0003
And now, it's here before me!@0003
Oh, Valter@0016... @0016Your death
will be slow and agonizing.@0003@000C@0011
# 0x0B20
@0009@0010@0142@0009Is that you, Cormag?@0003
Even you have turned your
back on your emperor?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0142@0009Don't tell me you stand there
thinking you can beat me.@0003
You're not strong enough.
You know this to be true.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0142@0009If you swear fealty to Grado
again, I may let you live.@0003
You don't want to die an
oath breaker, do you?@0003
Well? Will you crawl before me
and beg for forgiveness?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000C@0016...@0016Yes, I have broken my
vows, Valter.@0003
And yes, it may be I who falls
when we tilt lances@0016...@0016@0003
But a dog like you will never
see me crawl.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0142@0009Brave words from a traitor.@0003

as sharp as your tongue.@0003@0009@0011

If it isn't Joshua.@0003
It's been a long time.
Have you been well?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CI've been all right. Still
working as a mercenary.@0003
When did you get all proper
and join the Grado army?@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009Didn't I tell you?@0003
I wasn't about to waste my
life as a nameless soldier.@0003
Still, I think back on those
days a lot lately@0016...@0016@0003
My axe and your sword@0016...@0016@0003
The two of us were a deadly
pair, eh?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009By the way@0016...@0016
I know all about you, Joshua.@0003
Who you really are I mean.
The prince of Jehanna, huh?@0003
When did you plan on sharing
the wealth, you sneaky dog?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CListen@0016...@0016@0003
You can't reduce a nation to
loot waiting to be divided.@0003
And more importantly, I made
a vow to my mother.@0003
I'm going to succeed her as
ruler of my homeland.@0003@0002
Hey, Caellach@0016...@0016@0003
You're the one who killed
my mother, aren't you?@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009Yeah@0016... @0016Sorry 'bout that.
Things happen, you know?@0003
C'mon, Joshua,
don't hate me.@0003
This is war. There's nothing
you can do about it.@0003
Besides, grudges get in the
way of work, right?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CThat's true.
It's as you say.@0003
Listen, Caellach@0016...@0016
I've got to kill you now.@0003
Don't hold it against me.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009You arrogant@0016...@0016
You haven't changed a bit!@0003
I've always wanted to show
you who's better, Joshua.@0003
And I'm even stronger than
I used to be.@0003
I'm gonna wipe that smug look
off your face for good!@0003@0009@0011

How long's it been?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CAbout two years@0016...@0016
What've you been doing?@0003
You know, that innkeeper's

troop doing?@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CThey're getting by.@0003
Some of them ended up
feeding the crows, though@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009Is that so?@0003
Those were good times,
weren't they, Joshua?@0003
We were terrors on the
battlefield and worse off it.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CYeah, we were.@0003
You'd get carried away and
pick fights with me@0016...@0016@0003
You always said the same
thing: I will be king!@0003@000C@0011@0009@0010@0143@0009Yeah. That's my dream.@0003
And I'll do anything to
make it come true.@0003
What do you say, Joshua?
Let's team up again?@0003
Leave those losers you're
with and work for me.@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@012A@000CSorry, can't do it.@0003

much either.@0003
You're still as

That's the truth.@0003@0002

No offense, but you're not
in my league anymore.@0003

I can't tell you how happy

something to give you.@0003@000BWhat are these?@0003@0009These are called Sacred Twins. We
took these relics from Grado.@0003
The dark tome Gleipnir and
the black axe Garm@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I doubt either of us can use them, but@0016...@0016@0003
Why not see if one of your companions can
use them. They might have better luck.@0003@000BThey're from Grado?@0003

has fallen?@0003@0009Yes. I conquered the capital and

I've something to give you.@0003@000AThese are@0016...@0016@0003@000CThese are the Sacred Twin
relics of Jehanna.@0003
The ice sword Audhulma and
the wind blade Excalibur.@0003@000AJehanna's Sacred Twins?@0003
But it seems like we were
too late@0016...@0016@0003
Jehanna Hall has fallen.@0003@000CYes, and Queen Ismaire died
resisting Grado.@0003@0008@0010@0122@0008Now that we have, at last, been
reunited once again,@0003
perhaps this would be a good
time to share information.@0003
I'm sure we all are most anxious
to learn of what has happened.@0003
# 0x0B29
@0008@0010@0102@000A@0010@0114@000B@0010@010F@000D@0010@0122@000AI see unfamiliar faces among you here,
so allow me to introduce myself.@0003
I am Ephraim, Eirika's brother and
crown prince of Renais.@0003@000DI'm Princess L'Arachel of Rausten.
The pleasure is mine, of course.@0003@000AI'll begin by telling you of
how we've fared in our mission.@0003
We seized the Grado capital and
defeated her emperor, Vigarde.@0003
Grado's capital guard have, to a man,
surrendered and laid down their arms.@0003
Pockets of resistance remain, but the
war itself is over.@0003@000BIs that so?@0003@000AHowever, something remains that
still bothers me.@0003
A Grado man named Knoll told me about
something called a Dark Stone.@0003@0015@000ATheir mages had uncovered lore that led
them to craft a powerful magic stone.@0003
This Dark Stone may have been the
catalyst of Grado's transformation.@0003
It seems to be the source of that black
wave of energy Myrrh described.@0003@0015@000AVigarde died some time ago, but the power
of the stone played him like a puppet.@0003
The war and everything that passed since
was planned by the Dark Stone's master.@0003@000BWell? Who is it?@0003@0080@0004@000A@0016...@0016I still can't believe it,
but I'll tell you nonetheless.@0003
According to Knoll, the man behind
this is Lyon, the imperial prince.@0003
He said Lyon's got the Dark Stone.@0003@000BFigures it's Prince Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@0008No, that doesn't make any sense.@0003
Ephraim and I know Lyon better than
that. We've been friends for years.@0003
Lyon's not the sort of person who
could start a war like this.@0003@000BBut, Eirika@0016...@0016@0003@0008I saw Lyon recently.@0003
Ephraim, you might know this, but after
I abandoned the sea route to Rausten,@0003
I traveled overland with Prince
Innes to Jehanna.@0003
We ran into trouble with Grado's
forces, and I chanced upon Lyon.@0003
He didn't share the details of his
situation, but he intimated that@0003
he was on our side. Despite all
appearances, he was on our side.@0003
So Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@000AEirika,
I also met Lyon.@0003@0008Did you really?@0003@000AYes. But, he was like a
completely different person.@0003
To be honest, he didn't seem
to be completely@0016...@0016human.@0003@0008Ephraim@0016...@0016
What are you saying?@0003@000AI'll tell you what I saw.@0003
I found Lyon inside Grado Keep.@0003
This is what he told me:
He said he was behind this war.@0003
He said he'd befriended us solely so that,
one day, he could invade Renais@0016...@0016@0003
He told me he killed our father.@0003@0008That@0016... @0016That can't@0016...@0016@0003@000AI know. I can't believe it either.
I refuse to believe it.@0003
How could he have planned all
this since he was a child@0016...@0016@0003
I simply can't fathom it.@0003@0015
# 0x0B2A
@000AI've heard Lyon changed when he acquired
the Dark Stone.@0003
I've no interest in magic, but@0016...@0016
There was something uncanny about him.@0003
It seemed almost as though he were being
controlled by something himself.@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003@000BThe two of you might find this hard
to accept, but@0016...@0016@0003
The state of Prince Lyon's heart matters
little. He has the Dark Stone.@0003
That rock is the cause of all that's
happened. The prince must be stopped.@0003@0080@0004@000DNot yet. There is something
that needs doing first.@0003@0008L'Arachel?@0003@000DPrince Ephraim, I do believe you
felt it as well.@0003
The Dark Stone held by Prince Lyon@0016...@0016
It exudes a malefic miasma@0016...@0016@0003
We might be able to handle Prince Lyon
alone, but that stone is beyond our ken.@0003@0008Then what do you suggest?@0003@000DThe Sacred Stones.@0003@0008The Sacred Stones?@0003@000DWe've all heard the legend of the
five Sacred Stones.@0003
They alone possessed the power to
seal the Demon King away forever.@0003
So, of course, to dispel demonic
magic, we must use the Sacred Stones!@0003@000BYou expect us to pin the outcome
of this war on some fool legend?@0003@000A@0016...@0016Not just the legend.
We also have hope.@0003@0015@000AAccording to Lyon,@0003
he has already seen to the destruction of
Grado's, Frelia's, and Jehanna's stones.@0003@0008Hm. That explains something@0016...@0016@0003
Grado forces attacked me, intent on
destroying the Stone of Renais.@0003
If that could be the reason they
chose to invade Renais@0016...@0016@0003
The power of the Sacred Stones may
be greater than we'd ever known.@0003@000DYes, exactly!@0003
If we acquire a Sacred Stone, we'll be
able to oppose the Dark Stone's might!@0003@000BBut three of the stones have been
shattered, and our options are few.@0003
Do you suppose that, during the
invasion of Renais@0016...@0016@0003@000ANo, I don't think so.@0003
The Stone of Renais is hidden by the
power of Eirika's and my bracelets.@0003@0008Grado has made many attempts
to take our bracelets.@0003
Every one has failed, and so
the stone may still be safe.@0003@000AWe have to confirm that, of course.@0003
We've defeated Grado, and we must
turn our eyes to our homeland.@0003
It's time to return to Renais.@0003

timing is flawless, as ever.@0003
Riding in at the nick of time with your
armor shining and your lance ready@0016...@0016@0003
It must be nice to be the dashing hero.
I'd like to try it someday.@0003@0017@0017@0009@0016...@0016That's just like you, Forde.@0003
You make even a crisis such as this
seem like a stroll in the garden.@0003@000CThey say that's one of my best traits.@0003
You know, Prince Ephraim, you've changed
since the last time I saw you.@0003
You're more@0016--@0016how should I put it?@0016--@0016kingly?
Is that even a word?@0003@0009You've changed a bit, too. It looks
like the journey has made you strong.@0003
What say we show the Grado stragglers
how tough we've become? Let's go!@0003@000CMusic to my ears, milord.@0003
# 0x0B2F
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0118@0009Kyle!@0003@000CPrince Ephraim!@0003@0009You've done a great service in
protecting Eirika all this time.@0003
Assigning you the task was the
right thing to do.@0003@000CIt was no task@0016--@0016it was an honor. I shall
continue to protect her as best I can.@0003
Until your orders for me change, my
prince, I'll guard her well.@0003@0009We'll do so together, Kyle, because
this is where we join our forces.@0003
Let's you and I finish off these
last remnants of Grado's army.@0003@000CYes, sir!@0003@0009It looks like you've had plenty of
chances to improve your swordsmanship.@0003
I expect you to surprise me out there.@0003@000CYou've grown yourself, milord.@0003
You've the dignity of a king now.
Like your father before you.@0003@0009D-do you mean that?
You must be mistaken.@0003@000CI am not! It is precisely why I am,
now and forever, your loyal servant!@0003
# 0x0B30
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@010F@000CIt's been a long time, Ephraim.@0003@0009Innes, is that you?@0003@000CYou arrived sooner
than I'd expected.@0003
Eirika is safe. You've
no need to worry.@0003@0009I've heard that you've been
watching over Eirika.@0003
I should like to offer you
my gratitude.@0003@000CIt's not necessary. Besides,
there's still a war to be won.@0003
We can't rest easy till every last
Grado soldier's been defeated.@0003@0009You're right. Let's go!@0003
# 0x0B31
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0113@000CGeneral Duessel.@0003@0009Cormag!@0003
You're@0016...@0016here@0016...@0016@0003@000CI turned my back on Grado to
avenge my murdered brother.@0003
I never imagined I'd see you
abandon Grado's army, though.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Circumstance has made
me a traitor, it seems.@0003
It's ironic. Two men who threw away
their country, riding side by side.@0003@000CMm.@0003
General Duessel, I would consider it
an honor to serve under you again.@0003@0009No, I'm a man with no country.
I'm no longer a general of Grado.@0003@000CAnd I'm the same. Really, when
you look at it, nothing's changed.@0003
Then I simply choose you as the
man I ride with and protect.@0003@0009Cormag@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0B32
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0104@0009Princess Eirika,
are you well?@0003@000CSeth!
If you're here@0016...@0016@0003@0009Prince Ephraim is safe as well.@0003
Princess Eirika, we will stop the
remaining enemy soldiers here.@0003
Would you please take caution and
think of your own safety?@0003@000CThank you, Seth.@0003
You've saved me so many times
since the fall of Renais@0016...@0016@0003@0009It is my duty. Let's go,
Princess Eirika.@0003
# 0x0B33
@000C@0010@0102@000E@0010@012C@000E@0080@000B@0009Oh, Eirika!
Here you are!@0003@000CTana!
You've come as well?!@0003@0009Yes, I came all the
way with Ephraim.@0003
I'm just so happy to
see you're safe.@0003@000CTana. Thank you so much
for coming to my aid.@0003@0009Well, of course I came.
That's natural.@0003
We're friends after all!@0003
# 0x0B34
@000C@0010@010F@0009@0010@012C@0009B-Brother.@0003@000CTana?
Why are you here?@0003
I told you to remain at
Castle Frelia.@0003@0009Don't talk to me like that.@0003
I'm a fully sworn knight
of Frelia, you know?@0003
I came all the way here
with Prince Ephraim.@0003@000CWhat? With that man?@0003@0009Brother!
Ephraim's a good person.@0003
We can talk about this later.
I still see enemy troops about.@0003
I think we should join forces
and fight together.@0003@000CWorking together is, of course,
the best strategy.@0003
But don't do anything foolish, Tana.
Who knows what Father would think.@0003@0009I understand.@0003
You try not to be overly
heroic yourself, Brother.@0003
# 0x0B35
@000C@0010@0120@0009@0010@0121@0009Ah! Teacher.@0003@000CEwan? What are
you doing here?@0003@0009I came with Prince Ephraim
and his friends.@0003
I've done a lot of good
work, Teacher.@0003@000CIs that so@0016...@0016@0003
Well, if you all hadn't shown
up, I'm sure we'd be dead now.@0003
You've saved us, Ewan. Thank
you. I am in your debt.@0003@0009Do you mean that?@0003
As a reward, will you teach
me some more powerful magic?@0003@000C@0016...@0016I suppose I should at that.
But all in good time, Ewan.@0003@0009Yahoo!@0003

You there@0016...@0016
Take this, and do some good with it.@0003
# 0x0B37
@0009@0010@015D@000C@0010@FFFF@0009All the highest generals in Grado's army
receive titles named after gemstones.@0003
The emperor currently has six gemstones
fighting in his service.@0003@0002
Caellach, the Tiger Eye, commands the
forces fighting here.@0003
The Moonstone, Valter, is taking part in
this battle as well.@0003
Glen, also known as the Sunstone, died
in the mountains of Carcino.@0003
Selena Fluorspar was killed in
western Grado.@0003
Duessel, whom they call Obsidian,
is missing in action@0016...@0016@0003
The Blood Beryl, whose real name is
Riev, has also gone missing.@0003@0002
Hm?
How do I know all this?@0003
I know I may look young and naive,
but this is my job.@0003
I'm here to pass this information
along and help you out.@0003
And it's good information, too, so
don't waste it.@0003
# 0x0B38
@0009@0010@015B@000C@0010@FFFF@0009According to this ancient document@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016There was a huge battle here
long, long ago.@0003
Every day, I'm out here digging up ancient
weapons and artifacts out of the sand.@0003
There are still more to be found,
of that you can be sure.@0003
It's even said a long-dead sage left a
copy of Metis's Tome out here@0016...@0016@0003@0002
@0017Oh! But I won't give that to anyone

has happened to Castle Renais?@0003
How did it come to be so ruined?
So desolate?@0003@000CSpies report that the castle is
being held by the traitor Orson.@0003@0080@0004@000AOrson@0016...@0016@0003
In retrospect, I realize he's
been acting odd for a while now.@0003
He seemed so@0016...@0016dispirited.@0003@000CHis wife passed away some six
months back.@0003
The loss may have been too much
for his mind to bear.@0003
His love and devotion for his wife
were well known among the knights.@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003@000CNow, he sits alone in the king's
former bedchambers.@0003
He makes no effort to govern.@0003
No one is allowed to enter the
chambers, and he takes no meals.@0003@0008What could he possibly be doing?@0003@000CI do not know. The spies had no
insight into his behavior.@0003
He does nothing to deal with the dark
creatures and bandits roaming the land.@0003
Reports say all of Renais is engulfed
in chaos.@0003
Region after region is revolting, and
Orson's reign is already crumbling.@0003
Left alone, it may very well collapse
under the weight of its own neglect.@0003@000AWe cannot allow the situation
to reach that point.@0003@0015@000AWe're going home, Eirika.
We're going to the castle.@0003@0008I hear you, Ephraim.@0003

Now that Selena has returned
my dragonstone to me@0016...@0016@0003
I'll do what I can until its
power runs out.@0003
Let's take back your home.@0003@0008Are you sure about this?@0003@000CFor the two of you@0016...@0016
I simply want to help.@0003@000AAll right. I understand. But
you must make me a promise.@0003
You are never to stray from
our sides. Got that?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000COf course@0016...@0016@0003

steward of Renais.@0003

urchin like you, boy.@0003@000D@0010@016B@000DYou@0016... @0016You fool!@0003

He gives me the creeps.@0003
What do you think he's doing back there?@0003

Could he be dangerous?@0003@000CI don't care. I'm here for the money.
As long as I get paid, I'm happy.@0003
But on the subject of rumors, have you
heard the stories of the secret treasure?@0003

wealth hidden in Castle Renais.@0003

from the cold clutches of the grave@0016...@0016@0003
It's a shame that she'll be sent back

Before Renais fell, King Fado entrusted
me with this message:@0003@0002
Raise the twins' bracelets in the hall
of kings.@0003
The seal will be broken. The resting place
of the Sacred Stone will be revealed@0016...@0016@0003@000AI understand.@0003@0008So we're supposed to raise our
bracelets over our heads, right?@0003@000ALet's try it, Eirika.@0003@0008I'm ready, Ephraim.@0003
# 0x0B52
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0102@0009This is the Stone of Renais@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes. This is one of the five stones
that defeated the Demon King.@0003@0009If Lyon had acquired our bracelets, the
stone would have been destroyed by now.@0003
Together, we protected the only power
that can help us stop Lyon's insanity.@0003@000CYes. It's the only hope left to us.@0003
Hope for you and me, and the last
true hope for peace@0016...@0016@0003

Brother, look!
Our bracelets, they're@0016...@0016@0003@0009What is this?@0003
Are they reacting to the
light of the stone?@0003
# 0x0B54
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0102@000CI can't believe the bracelets
contain so much power@0016...@0016@0003@0009I wonder if Father anticipated all of this
long ago.@0003
When I was growing up, I never thought
about becoming king.@0003
I only wanted to be a good soldier, a good
warrior. The best on the battlefield.@0003
Father never understood what I wanted,
but@0016...@0016I never understood him, either.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009It was the same when Grado
invaded Renais.@0003
I should have stayed home
to defend the kingdom@0016...@0016@0003
Instead, I raced off to
fight for personal glory.@0003@000CBrother@0016...@0016@0003
I don't think you know how well
Father understood your feelings.@0003
When I last saw him, he was concerned
for nothing but our safety@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0011@000D@0010@0102@000B@0010@0114@0008@0010@0104@0008Eirika is correct. King Fado asked
after your exploits every day.@0003
He always told me what a fine king
you would one day make.@0003@000BFather@0016...@0016@0003@0008Now Prince Ephraim, Princess Eirika.
Please follow me.@0003
The Sacred Twins of Renais should be
near the stone's reliquary.@0003
# 0x0B55
@000C@0010@0114@0009@0010@0104@0009Ah, here we go. This lance can only
be one of the Sacred Twins of Renais.@0003
Please, Prince Ephraim, take this
sacred relic and feel its weight.@0003@000CSo this is one of our Sacred Twin
relics, is it? I've never seen them.@0003
Look, there's a name inscribed here.@0003@0002
Siegmund, the Flame Lance.@0003
# 0x0B56
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0104@0009And this blade is sister to the lance,
the other Sacred Twin of legend.@0003
Princess Eirika, if you would?@0003@000COf course.@0003
There's a name carved here as well.@0003@0002
Sieglinde, the Thunder Blade@0016...@0016@0003

@000C@0010@0102@000CThese are the ancient weapons of our
ancestors@0016--@0016the weapons of heroes.@0003
They were enshrined generations ago,
to be used only by the king@0016...@0016@0003
and only in times of dire need.@0003@0002
Such an awful power they possess, and
yet we need them to restore peace.@0003
I've seen enough of the horrors of
war, but I can't turn my back on it.@0003
If we merely turn our eyes away, we
surrender our world to atrocity.@0003
And so, I must fight.@0003
I'll do whatever I must do to bring
back the peace we once knew.@0003

@000C@0010@0150@000A@0010@012D@0008@0010@012E@001C@0008How do you intend to use the
Sacred Stone, Lyon?@0003
Do you really think you can
tap into its power?@0003@000CMm@0016... @0016My research isn't complete yet,
but there's no mistaking the power@0003
the Sacred Stones contain.@0003
And the Stone of Grado seems especially
responsive to my dark magic.@0003
I suppose it's because it contains
both sacred and demonic properties.@0003
Regardless, if I can just press
my studies a little harder@0016...@0016@0003
Well, I think I might be able to use
it to heal my father's illness.@0003
If that works, there's no telling how
many other people I can help as well.@0003@000ADo you think this is wise?@0003
The power contained within the stones
is beyond our understanding@0016...@0016@0003
My father tells me that the stones
possess a power not to be trifled with.@0003@000CUh-huh@0016...@0016
Father MacGregor is also against it.@0003
That's why they still won't give me
direct access to the Stone of Grado.@0003
For the time being, I've made do with
the radiant energies surrounding it.@0003
They're nothing compared to the raw
power of the stone itself, but@0016...@0016@0003
If I can show Father MacGregor some
real progress, perhaps one day@0016...@0016@0003@0008Using the Sacred Stones to
study magic@0016...@0016@0003@000CEphraim, Eirika, what do you
two think?@0003
Using the divine power of the
Sacred Stones in this way@0016...@0016@0003
You don't think it's a very
good idea, do you?@0003@0008@0016...@0016It's just that I know nothing
at all of magic.@0003
I would that there were some way I
could help you, but I simply can't.@0003@0002
But, Lyon, I've seen how hard you've
worked to help others.@0003
I know how much you want the power
to make others happy.@0003
I know these things, and because I
know you, I trust your intentions.@0003@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003@0008If you hope to use the power of the
Sacred Stone for good, I trust you can.@0003
I'm behind you all the way.@0003@000AI agree with Ephraim entirely.@0003
You spend every night in the library,
studying cures for your father's illness.@0003
The power of the Sacred Stones is too
powerful to be used for personal gain.@0003
But you, Lyon@0016... @0016I think you'll be
fine. You're the kindest person I know.@0003@000C@0017Thanks, both of you.@0003
Hearing those words from you means a
lot to me.@0003
@0017Actually@0016--@0016and this hasn't been made
public yet@0016--@0016but@0016...@0016@0003
I've already saved someone using the
knowledge I've gleaned so far.@0003@0008You have?@0003@000C@0017Uh-huh@0016...@0016@0003
A while back, a fire ravaged Serafew, and
a little girl got trapped in the flames.@0003
Her burns were terrible: not even healing
staves were able to cure her injuries.@0003
But just a sliver of the stone's power
restored her life and healed her wounds.@0003
We saved that girl's life, Ephraim!@0003
Oh, if you could have seen the tears
of joy in her mother's eyes!@0003@0017@0017@0008You really did it, huh?
You are special, Lyon.@0003
Congratulations!@0003@000CWell@0016...@0016thanks. But there's still so
much more to be done.@0003@0002
I am happy, though. To be honest, I
just want to be able to help people.@0003
I want to put the ancient magics to
use for the common good@0016...@0016@0003
That's how I feel.@0003@000ALyon@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CAnd as my research moves forward,
I'll be able to do much more, too.@0003
We have only the barest understanding
of how dark magic operates.@0003
Maybe we can use it not only to heal
wounds, but also to stop diseases@0016...@0016@0003
What if we can read the future,
predict disasters, move mountains!?@0003@000AHold on, Lyon. You can't take too
much on yourself all at once.@0003
What good is helping people if
you sacrifice yourself to do it?@0003@000COh@0016... @0016Yes, of course. Sorry.
I got carried away.@0003@0017@0008You have a soft heart, Lyon.@0003
I bet you haven't taken any
real time off at all.@0003@0002
So this is what we're going to do.
Today, we're going into the city.@0003
And you're going with us, Lyon.@0003@000CWhat?@0003
But, Ephraim, you've got a
history report due.@0003@0008We're taking today off.
C'mon, let's go.@0003@000C@0010@0150@000CBu-but, Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@000AIt's just one day, and I won't tell
anyone.@0003
Won't it be fun for the three of us
to spend a day in the city?@0003@000CEphraim, Eirika@0016...@0016@0003

It's like a dream@0016...@0016@0003@0009Syrene? I need a status report.@0003@000COh@0016...@0016
Oh, yes! Please forgive me!@0003
The Frelian troops we dispatched
were ambushed and decimated.@0003
My squad is all that remains.@0003@0009So many dead@0016...@0016@0003
You can rest easy now, Syrene.
I'm here. Victory is assured.@0003

We'll take over now. There's no
need for you to exhaust yourself.@0003@000CUnderstood.@0003
The chain of command must be clear, though,
so I'll take orders from your commander.@0003

@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0122@0009L'Arachel@0016...@0016
May I ask your advice?@0003@000CWhat is it, Eirika?
There's no need to be so formal.@0003@0009It's about Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@0002
My brother was right. Lyon's been
possessed by the Demon King.@0003
He@0016... @0016He's no longer the Lyon
I once knew.@0003
But I can't help feeling@0016...@0016there
must be some way to bring him back.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Please help me, L'Arachel.
I want to save him.@0003
Rausten is the spiritual heart of
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.@0003
You're their princess. You must know
something about the demons of legend.@0003
Is there anything that can save Lyon?@0003@0080@0004@000CI'm so sorry, Eirika.@0003
To the best of my knowledge,
there is no way to aid him.@0003@0009That can't be!@0003
There must be something!
Any clue, no matter how slight@0016...@0016@0003@0080@0004@000COur oldest legends tell us just this@0016...@0016@0003
Only one person has ever been able to
shake off the Demon King's domination.@0003
Rausten's founder, Saint Latona the
sure-hearted, shattered his fetters.@0003
If one possesses a strength of will
beyond that of normal men@0016...@0016@0003
Only then can one throw off the
shackles of the Demon King.@0003@0002
But you saw it for yourself, Eirika,
with your own two eyes.@0003
Your friend Lyon's body has already
been claimed by the Demon King.@0003
Once it's gone that far, @0005there's
nothing that can be done.@0003
When the Demon King takes over someone,
he devours his spirit, his very soul.@0003
Even if his hold on Lyon's body could be
released, that body would have no soul.@0003
There is no power in Rausten@0016...@0016not
even the Sacred Stone@0016...@0016@0003
that can perform so great a miracle
as to restore a shattered soul.@0003@0009But@0016...@0016@0003
Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@000CEirika@0016...@0016@0003
I understand how you feel,
but the prince is gone.@0003
The Lyon you knew no longer
exists.@0003@0002
It's more important now that
you care for yourself.@0003
If we pursue the Demon King,
we're likely to suffer for it.@0003
I want you to return to Rausten
Palace and rest yourself.@0003@0009Thank you, L'Arachel.@0003
However, I must stay with
the company.@0003
I have to believe there's something
I can do to help him.@0003
Lyon was always so kind. He wanted
nothing more than to help people.@0003
It's too terrible to picture him
imprisoned by the Demon King.@0003
Imprisoned@0016...@0016with no hope
of salvation.@0003
# 0x0B7B
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0122@000CE-Ephraim. I must ask
that you slow down!@0003
If you travel so swiftly,
we cannot keep up.@0003@0009I'm riding ahead. I can't
waste any more time.@0003
I must catch the Demon King
as quickly as possible.@0003@000CAnd when you find him?
Tell me, what then?@0003@0080@0004@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0002
@0016...@0016L'Arachel.@0003
Rausten is the spiritual heart of
Magvel. They keep the ancient lore.@0003
You're their princess. You must know
something about the demons of legend.@0003
I do not need consolation or peace of
mind. I need facts.@0003@0002
Lyon, as he is now@0016...@0016
Can he be saved?@0003@000CI'm sorry@0016...@0016@0003
To the best of my knowledge,
there's nothing to be done.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0080@0004@000CYour friend Lyon's body has already

I understand.
Let's go, L'Arachel.@0003@000CW-wait a moment. Hmph!
Were you listening to me at all?@0003
I'm sorry, but the prince@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0016...@0016I heard you.@0003
There's no hope of saving Lyon.@0003
And if I cannot save him@0016...@0016@0003
I will bring him peace with my
own hands.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
But@0016...@0016
Can you do it?@0003
Even if you get the chance, can
you bring yourself to kill him?@0003
It would be best if you and your
sister left this to the rest of us.@0003@0009No@0016...@0016I'm going to do it.@0003
Lyon is my friend.@0003
The Demon King stole him from me.
I will be the one to kill him.@0003@000CIf your mind's made up, there's
not much I can do, is there?@0003
Let's go then.@0003@0009I'm sorry, L'Arachel.@0003@000CThere's no need for you
to apologize.@0003
Your words alone have
won my forgiveness.@0003

I wanted to be just like you.@0003
Then one day I realized@0016...@0016@0003
Someone like me could never
become someone like you.@0003
You and Eirika are@0016...@0016overpowering.
You blinded me with your radiance.@0003
How could I live in your shadows
and not seethe with jealousy?@0003@0009Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@000CBefore I ever touched the
Dark Stone@0016...@0016@0003
I had a vision. A vision
of the future of Magvel.@0003
I saw myself standing with two
roads stretched out before me.@0003
One led to the Demon King,
devouring both my body and soul.@0003
The other showed me the power to
fight the Demon King's dominion.@0003
And I, well@0016...@0016@0003@0015@000C@0080@000E@000C@0016...@0016Gaa@0016...@0016urgh.@0003@0009Lyon!@0003@000CThen I acquired the Dark Stone.@0003
The Demon King began to eat my
soul and corrupt my flesh.@0003
I almost vanished beneath
the Demon King's mantle.@0003
Then I remembered you@0016...@0016
My mind blazed into wakefulness.@0003
All at once, my mind shouted
out, I will not be devoured!@0003
Just as I was about to lose
myself to the Demon King,@0003
I was able to drive him back.@0003
The Demon King's desires are
simple@0016--@0016foul, but uncomplicated.@0003
He wants nothing but the destruction,
conquest, and subjugation of man.@0003
Those shallow desires are nothing
to the dreams of the human heart.@0003@0002
And of the two roads I had seen,
I chose the latter.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CBut I didn't want to appear before
you here in the role of Lyon.@0003
Lyon, the piteous victim@0016...@0016
The Demon King, the fiendish villain@0016...@0016@0003
It was all an act@0016--@0016high drama for you
all, to suit this grand occasion.@0003@0002
That's right, Ephraim.@0003
I'm the Demon King@0016...@0016
The Demon King is me.@0003@0009You lie@0016...@0016@0003
It can't be. It's not possible.@0003
Lyon was@0016... @0016My friend was kind
and caring@0016...@0016@0003
He was a good person@0016...@0016@0003
But you@0016...@0016
You are not that person!@0003@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003@0009You@0016... @0016You're the Demon King.
Lyon is gone, and you are a liar!@0003
You're trying to trick me.
You're trying to confuse me!@0003@0002
I'm right, aren't I?! Tell me
I'm right, Lyon! TELL ME!@0003@000C@0080@000F@000DI'm sorry, Ephraim.@0003@0002
Ephraim, listen to me.@0003
Ten days from now@0016...@0016
When the moon is swallowed by shadow@0016...@0016@0003
In Darkling Woods, I will perform
a ceremony@0016...@0016@0003
Through this ceremony, I will
gain immense power.@0003
Power to change not only Grado,
but the entire world.@0003@0009Change@0016...@0016the world?@0003@000DBut after that@0016...@0016
I cannot save myself.@0003
I'll become the Demon King of old
and try to destroy all of mankind.@0003
Ephraim. If you want to stop this,
you must come to Darkling Woods.@0003
I want you to come. I need you to
stop me. You must promise.@0003

pursue him now@0016...@0016@0003@000BSo he got away, is that it?@0003@000AThere's no cause to be discouraged.@0003
Beyond these mountains lie the heart

Before we enter, we must head north
to Rausten.@0003
After all, we still need the
Sacred Stone of Rausten.@0003
As long as even one stone remains,

I am Eirika, Princess of Renais.@0003
I come to you today as an
emissary of Frelia.@0003@000DAnd I am Ephraim, Prince of Renais.@0003

That is a tough tale to swallow
all at once@0016...@0016@0003
However, I have heard of the fell
creatures in Darkling Woods.@0003
L'Arachel.@0003
You will need the Stone of Rausten
if we have any hope of victory.@0003@000CThat is so, Uncle.@0003
I would like permission
to open the temple seal.@0003@0009Hmm@0016... @0016There's no need to
rush yourself so, L'Arachel.@0003
You're home again, in this
blessed haven. You should rest.@0003@000CHow can I relax until I know that
our Sacred Stone is safe?@0003
At the least, I'd like to ensure
that the temple seal is intact.@0003
Oh@0016...@0016@0003@0009Is something amiss?@0003@000CI think we'll take a night to rest
after all. Everyone is so exhausted.@0003

What should I do?@0003@0015@0080@0004@0009Lyon was one of my dearest
friends@0016... @0016I feel so helpless.@0003
There's nothing I can do to
help him@0016...@0016@0003@000CYour friend is gone, Eirika.@0003
All that remains is the Demon
King, masquerading as Lyon.@0003
For the good of all humanity,
he must be defeated.@0003
Ah@0016... @0016If only it truly were
that easy, though.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003@000CEirika@0016...@0016
I never knew Prince Lyon.@0003
I cannot pretend to understand
the sadness you must feel.@0003
However, I do know this@0016...@0016@0003
If the Lyon you hold so dear
were here with you today@0016...@0016@0003
What do you think he would
want you to do?@0003@0009I can't@0016...@0016@0003
@0016......@0016@0003@000CThere's no need to rush, Eirika.@0003
Take your time and think it through.
You need to find your own answer.@0003
Now then, it's about time we found
ourselves something to eat.@0003
It's hard to be optimistic on an
empty stomach.@0003@0009@0080@001C@0009Yes, I'll be right there.@0003

a divine calling, but@0016...@0016@0003@0009You needn't worry, Uncle.@0003

Ah. I've seen your face
before, lizard.@0003
Yes, during that accursed
battle so long ago.@0003
When those wretched men bound
me in their fetters.@0003
They fought with an ally from
the dragonkin at their side@0016...@0016@0003

I must tell them their wait is over.

I am changed. I can no longer be

Now, as it once did so long ago, these

Dragons. That reminds me@0016...@0016@0003

both my body and soul.@0003
Down the other, I master the Demon
King, and with that power@0016...@0016urg@0016...@0016@0003

wrest away my will@0016...@0016@0003
I saw this, and I made my decision.
I walk the second road.@0003@0009You fool@0016...@0016@0003
The Demon King has blinded you to his
true wish. How can you not see it?@0003@0002
He's had you since the moment you
first held the Dark Stone.@0003
He has been hiding within you, luring you
deeper into the shadows of his heart.@0003
He commands you and remakes you to suit
his dark design.@0003@000C@0016...@0016You're wrong@0016...@0016@0003@0009You think yourself unchanged?
You think yourself the master?@0003
I see only more evidence that the
Demon King commands you now.@0003
Can you not sense@0016--@0016@0003@000CIt's not true! I@0016...@0016@0003
I will save everyone.@0003@0009Think back! Remember!@0003
Are you truly the man you used to be?@0003
Would you justify war and murder
to bring about peace and justice?@0003
Remember who you were, and tell me
if you are still yourself!@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
All of this matters not. I know
the Demon King has claimed me.@0003
It is not important@0016...@0016@0003
Not if I can save the world.
My own soul is irrelevant.@0003@0009@0016...@0016It is as I feared. You will
not give up this madness.@0003@0002
I am Morva, the dragonkin who guards
the entrance to these woods.@0003
I do not have the ability to save you.@0003
All I can do is destroy the demon that
coils around your heart.@0003
To prevent the further
damnation of your soul@0016...@0016@0003
I can only grant you eternal sleep.@0003@000CI cannot sleep.

do what I was born to do.@0003

But that's@0016...@0016@0003@000AYou've seen the scrolls. You know there
is a way to stop the coming disaster.@0003
If those scrolls are correct, the rites
they describe can save all of Grado.@0003
But it will require a staggering amount
of dark energy@0016--@0016and a sacrifice as well.@0003

these rites demand@0016...@0016@0003@0002
And yet@0016...@0016@0003
Of the five Sacred Stones, Grado's
alone possesses a greater power@0016...@0016@0003
It is the very prison housing the soul
of the ancient Demon King.@0003
If we could harness its power, well@0016...@0016@0003

disaster and save countless lives.@0003@0008But you forget@0016...@0016@0003@000AI forget nothing!

we probably won't meet again@0016... @0016Not
like this, I mean. Not as friends.@0003@0009What's that got to do with anything?@0003
Kings are humans, too. Emperors
need not be friendless, you know.@0003@000CI suppose you're right. You have a knack
for cutting to the heart of things.@0003

not something you can take lightly.@0003
I really don't think we'll be the

You know that I do, too.
I spoke the truth to you@0016...@0016@0003
I truly thought that we
would always be friends.@0003@0002
That's why I@0016...@0016@0003
I have to stop you.@0003@000COf course. I know@0016...@0016@0003
You are Ephraim, after all.
You could do no less, my friend.@0003

Demon King, as in the stories of old!@0003@000CYou must listen to me, Eirika.@0003
The stories are true: the stone does
hold the power to stop the Demon King.@0003
However, the source of its power is human
will, the desire for peace within our hearts.@0003@0009In our hearts?@0003@000CYes, that's right.@0003

mirrored in our actions today.@0003@0017@000BNo, we've done far more than the
legends ever told.@0003
We've destroyed the Demon King's
body. He can never come back.@0003@0008That's right. And we have you
all to thank for it.@0003@000AAnd another thing@0016...@0016@0003
In that ancient battle, it took the might
of the five heroes to do what we did.@0003
We did not have their extraordinary
power to draw upon.@0003@0008No, we didn't. We conquered darkness and
restored peace to the land, thanks to you.@0003

stopped fighting. None of you, not once.@0003

to prepare for such a simple trip?@0003@0017@0009Rest easy, Ephraim. There's no need
to be so curt with your own sister.@0003
After all, a king must learn to treat
women with honor and discretion.@0003
That's what Father MacGregor says.@0003@000BThank you, Lyon. You, unlike my dear
brother, are a true gentleman.@0003@0017@0015@000BI was up far too late thinking about
my prayer to the temple flame last night.@0003
And I'm afraid I@0016...@0016I overslept@0016...@0016@0003@000DYour prayer? What are
you babbling about?@0003@0017@0009Come now, you know that flame has been
burning since the time of darkness ended.@0003
You must know the story that the flame
will answer the prayers of any pilgrim!@0003@000DReally? I didn't know that@0016...@0016@0003@000BOh, Ephraim@0016... @0016Father MacGregor is going to
scold you for neglecting your studies so.@0003@000D@0016...@0016Don't even joke about that.@0003
So tell us, what have you decided to
pray for, Eirika?@0003@000BI, uh@0016...@0016@0003
It's a secret.@0003@000DI should've known.
You're so boring.@0003@0009Well, how about you, Ephraim?@0003@000DMe? Let's see@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I guess I'll pray to become
a stronger fighter.@0003@0009That's just like you, Ephraim.@0003@000BJust like you indeed, Brother.@0003@000D@0016...@0016I can never tell if you're
complimenting me or mocking me.@0003@0009Praising you, of course!
Right, Eirika?@0003@000BHee hee@0016...@0016
Yes, that's right.@0003@000DAnd you, Lyon?
What will you pray for?@0003@0009What? Me?@0003
Hm@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I suppose all I really want is
for all our people to be happy.@0003@000D@0016...@0016That's very, uh@0016...@0016@0003
That's very much like you.@0003@000BVery much so, Lyon.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Now, I'm the one who cannot tell
if he's being praised or@0016...@0016@0003@000DYou're being praised, as always, Lyon.@0003@0017@000BTell me, why the sudden decision to visit
the temple?@0003
Did my brother do something again?@0003@000DNow listen, you@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh no. It's not what Ephraim's done.
It's what he hasn't done.@0003
He's learned nothing at all about the
Sacred Stones and the temple flame, so@0016...@0016@0003@000DFather MacGregor became angry.@0003
He said, One destined to become
king and rule over a nation@0016...@0016@0003
must know the history of his kingdom
and must respect the Sacred Stones.@0003
Ever since I came to Grado, my life has
been chastisement and castigation.@0003
Father MacGregor does not think me
to be altogether too@0016...@0016kingly.@0003@0009And yet General Duessel has nothing
but praise for you, Ephraim.@0003
He says you're brave and true, that
you've the makings of a great king.@0003@000DA great king?@0003@0015@000DI honestly have no idea what that means.@0003
Eirika should succeed the throne.@0003
I would be happy simply taking my lance
and traveling the land as a mercenary.@0003@000BEphraim, that is nothing but foolish,
irresponsible romanticism!@0003
Do you realize how much your words would
fill Father's heart with grief?@0003@000DAre we speaking of the same man? Our
father will likely outlive us all.@0003
For now, I'm content just learning
the lance from General Duessel.@0003@0015@000DWhat about you, Lyon? Is there
anything you want to do?@0003@0009Me? Well, I@0016...@0016@0003
I suppose I want to become
like my father.@0003@000BYou were born to be the Emperor
of Grado, Lyon. It suits you.@0003@0009No, I don't think so.
I'm not@0016--@0016@0003@0015@0009One thing I do know from watching my
father is that being emperor is hard.@0003
Every day, he answers the complaints of the
people, and he almost never sleeps@0016...@0016@0003
My father is always so very tired.@0003@0002
I hope one day that@0016...@0016
I hope that I can help him.@0003@000BLyon@0016... @0016You are so honorable.@0003
You should learn from him, Brother.@0003@0017@000D@0016...@0016Again with your criticism!@0003
Tell me, Eirika. What say you to dressing
like me and becoming king in my stead?@0003
You're so skinny, I doubt anyone would
notice you're not really a man.@0003@0009Ha ha ha@0016...@0016@0003@000B@0080@000D@000BEphraim!@0003

How do you think Lyon felt?@0003@000CHe's always been so gentle, but he worships
his father. He'd never question him.@0003@0015@000CBut the emperor@0016... @0016He's clearly not
behaving rationally.@0003

south to engage Grado directly.@0003
Our troops are proving themselves superior,
and the battle progresses favorably.@0003@0009Hmm@0016...@0016@0003@0002
But the riddle still
needs answering.@0003
Why did Grado begin this
war in the first place?@0003@000C@0011@000C@0010@0102@000CYour Majesty, we may well have found
something relating to that@0016...@0016@0003
We learned something on our travels,
news that weighs heavily upon us.@0003@0009Ah, yes. Our messenger delivered
your report to us a few days ago.@0003
Grado is trying to destroy the
Sacred Stones@0016... @0016Is that it?@0003@000CYes.@0003@0009We've strengthened the tower's defenses.
Frelia's stone is safe for the time being.@0003@0015@0009But we remain confused in this.@0003
What does Grado hope to gain by
destroying the Sacred Stones?@0003@000CWe don't know. The legends say the stones
protect us all from the power of darkness.@0003@000C@0011@000B@0010@0114@000F@0010@0126@000B@0016...@0016I can't say if it relates, but
I have a story about Grado.@0003

like to share it with you all.@0003@0015@000BMyrrh. Come here, please.@0003@000FYes?@0003@000F@0080@000F@0009Who's this girl?@0003

fighting in Grado territory.@0003
Myrrh, would you please tell everyone
here the story you told me?@0003@000B@0016......@0016@0003
@0016...@0016Please, Ephraim, you tell them.@0003@000B@0011@000DShe's a bit shy.@0003@000D@0011@000B@0010@0114@0015@000BVery well. Myrrh tells me that she belongs
to an ancient race of dragon folk.@0003
They're mentioned in a few legends.
They're called the tribe of Manakete.@0003@0008Manakete?@0003@000AYes, their name appears several times
in the tale of the Sacred Stones.@0003
It says they were neither human nor
demon but a separate, aloof race.@0003@000BPlease, Myrrh.@0003@000D@0010@0128@000D@0016......@0016@0003
We live in the east@0016...@0016in Darkling Woods.@0003
One day@0016...@0016@0003@0008Yes?@0003@000DWe felt something.@0003
An ominous energy to the south.@0003@000BFrom the direction of Grado.@0003
They felt a@0016...@0016force flowing
out of the Grado Empire.@0003@000DSaleh and I@0016...@0016
We went to investigate this energy.@0003
But on our way, we came across a battle
and were drawn into the conflict@0016...@0016@0003@000BMyrrh got lost and was wandering aimlessly
in an isolated region near Grado's border.@0003@000DI met some wicked folk there. They
deceived me and enchained me.@0003
They stole my dragonstone. They
were preparing me for transport.@0003@0015@000DIt was in that moment when Ephraim
appeared and rescued me.@0003@0008@0016......@0016@0003@000BI stumbled across Myrrh by chance
when Grado's men had ambushed us.@0003
Everything she told me seemed
beyond belief, and yet@0016...@0016@0003@0002
And yet, when I saw her wings,
what could I do but believe?@0003@000DThis dark wave of energy still
flows from the southlands.@0003
Its current is strong and runs deep.
It has awakened the evil ones.@0003
I want to stop it.@0003@000AHmmm@0016......@0016@0003@000D@0011@000D@0010@016F@0080@0004@000DYour Majesty! I bring word!@0003@000AWhat is so urgent you would

of Frelia@0016...@0016@0003
It's been destroyed by the Grado army!@0003@000AWhat? That's impossible!@0003

Dark energies from the empire's capital@0016...@0016
Evil monstrosities roaming our lands@0016...@0016@0003

We are in dark times once again.@0003
But even so, we cannot sit here,
wringing our hands.@0003@0015@0009First, we must warn the nations that
house the remaining Sacred Stones.@0003
If Vigarde seeks to destroy the Stones,
they are all in grave danger.@0003
Jehanna and Rausten must be warned.@0003
The nations must join together to
fight our common foe.@0003@000C@0010@0102@000CDo you think they will believe us?@0003@0009Hm@0016...@0016@0003

not want you to go.@0003
I would rather you wait

I will be fine. There's no
need for you to worry.@0003
Mine is the easiest task, 
and I'll be in no danger.@0003@0015@0009I'm far more worried about
your mission.@0003
Challenging the might of an
empire with a handful of men?@0003@000CWhat's this now? Have you
lost your faith in me?@0003@0009No, of course not.@0003
I know your true strength, Ephraim.
No one can defeat you.@0003@0017@000CHa ha! Hearing you say that
fills me with confidence.@0003@0015@000CI think I know my own limitations.@0003
I won't overextend my reach. I can't
die and leave you on your own, can I?@0003@0009Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@000CLet us both survive to be reunited.@0003

Kyle, Forde, I'm traveling

I ask that you two serve
my brother well.@0003@000BActually, there's been a
slight change of plans.@0003@000DWe're going with you, Your Highness.@0003@001C@0008What?
But@0016...@0016@0003@000DPrince Ephraim rides with
Frelia's finest at his back.@0003@000BAnd this was a personal order
from the prince himself.@0003
He said, I don't need you loafing
around here. Go keep Eirika safe.@0003
Since when is battling all of Grado
loafing about? Honestly!@0003@0008You're right! My brother's mission
is far more dangerous than mine.@0003
I will go and speak with him@0016...@0016@0003@000DPrincess Eirika.@0003
Prince Ephraim said he's not
concerned for his own safety.@0003
These are the words our prince gave
us, and we believe he means them.@0003@000BThat's the truth of it.@0003
There's no cause for worry, Princess Eirika.
We can all attest to the prince's tenacity.@0003
No matter how close death comes, the Pale
Horse will not catch him.@0003@0008@0016...@0016Kyle, Forde@0016...@0016@0003@0002

You are my brother's most trusted

We ride for Renais and

combat. His road is far more perilous.@0003
I will go and speak to him@0016...@0016@0003@000CLady Eirika.@0003
Prince Ephraim said he is not

I'm leaving Eirika in your care.@0003@000CActually, milord@0016...@0016@0003
We have the honor of

What about Eirika?@0003@000CThe princess informs me that she will
be accompanied by a Frelian escort.@0003
She tells me she does not need a
large retinue on such a small ship.@0003@0009I understand, but we must be
prepared for anything.@0003
I will be fine, Seth. Please
go and attend Eirika.@0003@000CLord Ephraim, this is Lady Eirika's wish.@0003
She implored us to lend our blades to you
on the front lines@0016...@0016@0003
She spoke to each of us individually. She
knelt before us and beseeched us to go.@0003
Her sincerity, her concern@0016... @0016We could
not help but be moved by her plea.@0003@0009Oh, Eirika@0016...@0016@0003
Very well. You will all
come with me.@0003
But steel yourselves. This will
not be an easy journey.@0003
I want only volunteers who are
unafraid of meeting death.@0003@000CI'll let the others know.@0003
I must tell you, milord@0016--@0016they are
already preparing to depart.@0003
They know the risks they are taking,
and not a one will be deterred.@0003

Eirika and Ephraim will now part ways.
Which of them will you accompany?@0003

Go with Eirika to Rausten.

Go with Ephraim to Grado.

@0017@0009@0010@0122@0009It is time for me to be on my
way, my friends.@0003
As the princess of Rausten, I still
have many duties to perform.@0003@0015@0009Oh, Princess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003
If it please you, I would be ever so
delighted if you joined my tea club.@0003
I insist that you come. Oh, say you
will, won't you?@0003
# 0x0C1A
@0009@0010@012A@0009I've much to do here in Jehanna.@0003
I'll start with what can be done
and keep going from there.@0003
First, I must talk to Mother.@0003
She should know that we've won,
so that she can rest easily.@0003
# 0x0C1B
@0017@0009@0010@0126@0009Lady Eirika@0016...@0016@0003
I must return to Caer Pelyn
and meet with the grand elder.@0003
I'm sure she is most worried
as well.@0003
But I was wondering@0016...@0016@0003
May I come to visit you from
time to time?@0003
# 0x0C1C
@0009@0010@010F@0009We of Frelia will do what we can to
aid in the restoration of Renais.@0003
If you have need of our assistance,
you have but to ask.@0003
I seldom trust people who act from
purely altruistic motives@0016...@0016@0003
@0017But I'll grant you that friendships
are a worthy exception to my distrust.@0003@0017

You must be exhausted after the
journey. Shall we rest, Eirika?@0003@0008That would be nice@0016...@0016@0003
But first we must seal
this away@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0008This stone banished the Demon King.@0003
With such power@0016...@0016@0003
Do you suppose we could bring
back Father and Lyon@0016...@0016@0003
That everyone who died in this
dreadful war could be@0016--@0016@0003@000D@0080@000E@000CEirika.@0003@0008@0080@000B@0009I know, I know. Such things would be@0016--@0016
I cannot wish for such things.@0003
No matter how it hurts, or rather because
it hurts, we must learn to accept sorrow.@0003
We must take it into our hearts
and tame our grief@0016...@0016@0003@000CEirika@0016...@0016@0003@0015@000CTell me, Sister@0016...@0016@0003
If Lyon were here with us, what
do you think he would want?@0003@0017@0009What he would want?@0003@000CYes. You see, I think I know.
It was the reason for his studies.@0003
It's why he wanted to know about the
Sacred Stones@0016--@0016or rather the Fire Emblem.@0003
Let's take Lyon's dreams and fulfill
them in his stead.@0003
We can do that, can't we? Without
relying on any mystic power?@0003@0009You're right, Brother, we can.@0003
Let us fulfill his dreams.@0003
As Lyon wanted, as we all want@0016...@0016@0003@0002

I am still princess of Rausten, after all.

that distance can be managed somehow.@0003

It@0016...@0016wasn't such a bad thing, fighting

home, and now@0016...@0016@0003@0009I'm sorry, Eirika.@0003

I just received word from Seth.@0003
In the south, within the empire,
there has been an enormous landslide.@0003@000CA landslide?@0003@0009Yes. Word is it was so great that
whole cities were destroyed.@0003
They say the damage is so severe,
the empire itself is in danger@0016...@0016@0003@000CThat's@0016...@0016@0003@0009That's why I must go to Grado.@0003

divine punishment@0016...@0016@0003
But these are the same citizens Lyon
wanted nothing more than to protect.@0003
I cannot ignore their plight.@0003@000CYes, of course not.
I will ride with you.@0003@0009No, you must remain in Renais.@0003
Our country is recovering, but we
cannot rest easy.@0003
Someone must stay to protect the realm.@0003@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003

me if you need anything.@0003
I'll always be nearby.@0003@0009Yes, thank you.@0003
But you do understand that I
am here to fight, don't you?@0003@0002
I cannot ask you to watch 
me constantly.@0003@0002
I am your sister, not your ward.@0003@000CEirika@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0080@000D@0009Wait, don't@0016...@0016@0003
What are you@0016--?@0016@0003@000B@0017You looked a little upset@0016...@0016@0003
I thought I would stroke your
face like I used to@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009Please stop it. You're treating
me like a child@0016...@0016@0003@000B@0080@000E@000C@0017Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just an old habit@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Besides, you were always the one who
pestered me to do it when we were little.@0003
Don't you remember?@0003@0009N-no, I don't remember!
That was such a long time ago@0016...@0016@0003
Ahh@0016... @0016Dear brother, please try to
remember where we are right now.@0003
What would our companions say if they
saw us in such a personal moment?@0003@000C@0017Yes, that would be embarrassing@0016...@0016@0003
Forgive me, I did not mean to do
anything you would find unpleasant.@0003@0017@0009N-no@0016...@0016@0003
I didn't mean that@0016...@0016
It's just@0016--@0016@0003@000C@0017So, you really do want
me to stroke your face?@0003@0017@0009No! I mean, look@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Ha ha, you always did blush so easily!
You haven't changed at all!@0003@0017@0009E-enough! Brother@0016...@0016you are
starting to anger me!@0003
# 0x0C54
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0114@0009@0080@000B@0009Yaa@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000C@000AYaa!@0003@0006@000CEirika, try taking a deeper step
forward when you lunge.@0003
Otherwise, you might find it hard to
dodge the counterthrust of a foe.@0003
That's why you always want to end
a duel with a single blow.@0003
Don't give your opponent the chance
to return the attack.@0003@000A@0080@000B@0009Ah, Brother!
Thank you for the instruction!@0003
I suppose I still have a lot to learn.@0003@000C@0017No, not at all!@0003
Rather, I am surprised at your rapid
progress after such a short time!@0003
I think you would give me an excellent
match were we to spar.@0003@0017@0009You really think so? And yet, I feel@0016...@0016@0003
Sigh@0016... @0016If only we lived in a world where
such skills were not even necessary.@0003@000C@0017I see@0016... @0016You're a peaceful soul.@0003
All of this fighting@0016...@0016
It must be hard on you.@0003@0017@0009It is@0016...@0016@0003
I just pray that this fighting
will end as swiftly as possible.@0003
No one desires this war.@0003
So why must it continue?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Indeed.@0003
And yet there is fighting in
every generation.@0003
In ancient times, our ancestors
fought all manner of evil beast.@0003
But once the beasts were subdued,
man then fought against fellow man@0016...@0016@0003
So we learned from Lyon.@0003@0009I know@0016...@0016@0003
But if men understand the futility
of fighting, why do they do it?@0003
We could gain so much more by
cooperation than by conquest.@0003@000CYou may be right@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016But I think@0016...@0016
I understand why.@0003@0009Why, Brother@0016...?@0016@0003@000CI pray for peace to return to our
fair Renais.@0003
I know that war brings only sorrow.@0003
And yet, somewhere in my heart@0016...@0016@0003
There is a lust for battle that
cannot be stilled.@0003
It screams within me when
I clutch this spear@0016...@0016@0003@0009Brother@0016...@0016@0003@000CPerhaps it is because I am a man.@0003
Perhaps it is because I was raised
to fight.@0003@0002
I enjoy the practice of my art. I find
pleasure in the battle victorious.@0003
And the stronger I become@0016...@0016@0003
The more strongly the call to arms
sounds within my ears.@0003
I want to see how great is the skill
that I have acquired.@0003
It may be crass and low, but I cannot
deny it.@0003@0009Brother@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou would disdain me for this?@0003@0009No, I could never@0016...@0016@0003
But, Brother, listen.
No matter why you fight@0016...@0016@0003
Please ensure that this fighting brings
good to our people and to our kingdom.@0003@000COf course.
I am not so far gone as that.@0003
And I could not bear to see
you cry for our people.@0003
@0017Besides, I would fear the judgment
of your mighty sword!@0003@0017@0009Brother, I@0016--!@0016@0003@000C@0017Ha ha! I'm joking, of course!@0003@0017
# 0x0C55
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0114@0009Just@0016...@0016a bit longer.@0003@000CYes, you may be right. There may be
an end to this fighting soon.@0003
We may yet defeat the evil in this land
and return it to the hands of men.@0003
Then, Renais may enjoy its former glory.@0003@0009@0017Yes@0016...@0016@0003
You will be crowned king of Renais,
and I will help you rebuild our land.@0003
We will make it a happy and prosperous
country, free of conflict.@0003
Just as we three used to dream
about@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CWe@0016...@0016three.@0003
Lyon was here with us, wasn't he?@0003
We three had so many grand ideas
for the futures of our lands.@0003@0009@0017Yes@0016...@0016
We talked about a lot.@0003
@0017But Lyon@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009Brother@0016...@0016@0003

won't ever leave me alone.@0003
Please@0016...@0016promise@0016...@0016@0003@000COf course.
I would never leave you.@0003
@0017Why would you ever think I
could do something like that?@0003@0017@0009Brother@0016...@0016@0003@000CI know better than anyone how you
feel, dear sister.@0003
Ever since we were born@0016...@0016
No, even before@0016...@0016@0003
We two have always been together.@0003
And together@0016...@0016

Ever since the castle fell
you have been protecting me,@0003
despite your own injuries@0016...@0016@0003@000CWould that I could have served
you better, my lady@0016...@0016@0003
You were not meant to see such things.@0003
But my wound has closed up, and it
does not affect my lance arm@0016...@0016@0003@0009Wait.
Show it to me.@0003
Look. The wound has closed, but
it has not yet fully healed.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
What made you think of this, my lady?@0003@0009Your fighting is as superb as ever, Seth.@0003
But when you raise your lance, I see a
flicker of pain on your face,@0003
as if you were merely enduring it@0016...@0016@0003
But it only lasts a moment. Perhaps
it is all just my imagination@0016...@0016@0003@000CYour Highness, please put your
mind at ease.@0003
My wound has healed. There
is no reason to worry.@0003@0009I would that were so, Seth.@0003
Please do not overextend yourself.
I beg this of you.@0003
Without you, I may not be able
to continue this quest@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou praise me too much, my lady@0016...@0016@0003

You have improved yet again.@0003@0009Thank you.@0003
It is only because I know my brother will
scold me if I do not practice every day.@0003
But I still am nowhere near your
level of skill, Seth.@0003@000C@0016...@0016My lady, I hardly think@0016...@0016@0003@0009Perhaps next time, you could spar with
me and help me learn some technique?@0003
The basics I've learned from my brother
all apply to skills with the spear.@0003
If I could learn the sword techniques
of the Knights of Renais,@0003
then perhaps I could be even stronger.@0003
I would be of greater help to you
on the battlefield.@0003@0017@000CYes, but@0016...@0016@0003
Princess Eirika, I think you should
stay away from the front lines.@0003
You are of the royal family of Renais.
Please leave the fighting to me@0016...@0016@0003@0009Still@0016...@0016@0003
How can I just watch from afar while
others risk their lives for me?@0003
I cannot rely on you always.@0003
I must learn to protect myself.@0003
So please, continue to observe
as I practice.@0003@000CPrincess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0C58
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0104@0009Seth, do you have a moment?@0003
Could you help me practice
a bit right now?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Princess Eirika.@0003
Before I do, there is something
I must say to you.@0003@0009Yes, what is it?@0003@000CPlease forgive my rudeness@0016...@0016@0003
Princess, I am merely your subject.@0003
Recently, you have been too close to me.@0003
It is not becoming of a noble of Renais to
fraternize in this way with her subjects.@0003@0009Oh@0016... @0016But I@0016...@0016@0003
it's just that your wound
has not yet@0016...@0016@0003
I was merely@0016...@0016@0003@000CIt's true. The wound I received the day
our castle fell has not yet healed@0016...@0016@0003
Perhaps it will afflict me to the end
of my life.@0003
But it would be a mistake to assume
you owe me a debt for this wound.@0003
This thought should not rest beneath
the crown you soon must wear.@0003@0009But still, you suffered for me@0016...@0016@0003@000CLady Eirika.@0003
You are a noble of Renais.@0003
The nobility should not favor
one subject over another.@0003
How can they maintain their fealty
if you treat one so differently?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CYou may have to forego such attachments
just to defend your country.@0003
There will be times when victory
in battle demands a sacrifice.@0003
If you cannot send your men to die,
then you are not fit to rule.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
I understand@0016...@0016@0003
Seth@0016...@0016
You are correct.@0003
I had forgotten my place,
and I had forgotten my duty.@0003
Please forgive me.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009That night@0016...@0016
We fled from the soldiers of Grado@0016...@0016@0003
You held me tight, keeping me safe
from the enemy's blades@0016...@0016@0003
Perhaps@0016...@0016I did feel something
more for you then.@0003
But@0016...@0016it was improper for a
queen of Renais.@0003
And with my father dead, I suppose
that is my station.@0003
I am a queen, and you are a knight
in my service.@0003
If I do not keep this in mind, then I will
never be able to rebuild our kingdom.@0003@000CI thank you for your understanding,
my lady.@0003
Now, if you will excuse me@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0011@0009@0016......@0016@0003@0015@0007@000C@0010@0104@0005@000CPrincess Eirika.@0003

one more thing@0016...@0016@0003@0009Seth@0016...?@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016That night@0016...@0016@0003

When I held you in my arms as
we rode into the night@0016...@0016@0003
It was the first time since I was
knighted that I forgot my duty.@0003
I thought of you not as my queen,@0003
but rather as someone I wanted
to protect from all harm.@0003
I wanted to leave everything behind@0016...@0016@0003
To take you far away to someplace
where we could be together@0016...@0016@0003
Those were my thoughts@0016...@0016@0003@0009Seth@0016...@0016@0003@000CPlease forgive me.@0003
I swear to you that I will never
again forget my duty in that way.@0003
Now, please excuse me.@0003
When I see you next, it will be
as a Knight of Renais@0016...@0016@0003

What a funny thing that we should meet
here! It is providence, I tell you!@0003@0009L'Arachel, it is NOT providence.
It is not even a coincidence.@0003
We agreed to meet here when we
planned out our battle strategy.@0003
Wait@0016... @0016Don't tell me that you
don't remember that!@0003@000CWe planned this?@0003
I suppose I simply don't usually
worry about such trifling details.@0003
And here we are, so I suppose that
our plan must be working.@0003@0009I suppose you're right.@0003@000CStill, divine providence or not,
isn't it strange and wonderful?@0003
A beautiful princess traveling with
such a ragged bunch as this@0016...@0016@0003
You could have told me much sooner,
you know!@0003@0009My apologies.@0003
Necessity demanded that I conceal
my identity at the time.@0003@000C@0017Oh, it is no longer any worry.@0003
To be honest, I believe I had figured out
your ruse from the very moment we met.@0003
I said to myself, This lovely woman
could only be of my own superior breeding.@0003
After all, you could never truly fool
a woman with my keen mind.@0003@0017@0009My. How@0016...@0016impressive.@0003@000CThere is something about nobility that
simply cannot be hidden from its kin!@0003
@0017Why, Eirika, certainly you must have
felt the same thing upon seeing me?@0003
You surely saw a refinement and grace of
carriage surpassing that of common folk?@0003@0017@0017@0009Err@0016... @0016Aheh@0016...@0016@0003
Yes, why@0016...@0016the very first time
I met you, I could see that you@0016...@0016@0003
You were very far from common.@0003@000CExactly. Far from common. I could
not have put it better myself.@0003
It's simply impossible to travel
incognito these days.@0003

@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0102@0009@0080@000B@0009Take that!@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009@0080@000B@0009And that and that and that!@0003@000CL'Arachel?@0005
What are you doing?@0003@0009I'm practicing! I want to be prepared
for when those fiends next show up.@0003
You never can tell where or when
they'll appear, after all.@0003
And if they were to appear and I were
unable to prepare a magical attack@0016...@0016@0003
Well, I'd like to be ready to whack
them with this staff of mine.@0003@000CAhhh@0016... @0016Don't you think that's a
bit, well, dangerous?@0003
Perhaps you should stop.@0003
If monsters appear when I am around,
I promise I'll come to your aid.@0003@0009That's simply no good, Eirika. You
know how those monsters can be.@0003
I insist that I be able to hold my
own, relying on nothing but my skills.@0003@000CI've been curious about
something, L'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003
Why are you so obsessed
with fighting monsters?@0003@0009@0016...@0016My parents were kind people. I would
be like them if I am able.@0003
My home of Rausten is so near to Darkling
Woods. We experienced many sudden raids.@0003
@0017My parents took it upon themselves to
defend our people against the monsters.@0003@0017@000CI had no idea@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yes, but my parents are gone now.@0003
I've been told that they passed away
when I was but an infant.@0003
They@0016...@0016gave their lives defending
many helpless people.@0003@000CI'm so sorry.@0003@0009Oh, you needn't be sad. I would
not want for that.@0003
No, it's wonderful that they gave
their lives battling that filth.@0003
I was so young that I do not remember
their faces, if I must be honest.@0003
@0017However, that does not diminish the
pride I feel for what they've done.@0003@0017@000CDon't you feel lonely at
the loss of your parents?@0003@0009No! Not at all!@0003
What do you take me for?
Some kind of weakling?@0003@000C@0017No, I see that you are
strong indeed, L'Arachel.@0003@0017@0017@0009I should say so.@0003
But@0016...@0016would you not say that
you are strong, too, Eirika?@0003
Your father stayed in his castle,
fighting the forces of Grado.@0003
He had a noble death, don't
you think?@0003
Your father was a great man.@0003
You must be quite proud of him.@0003@000CWell@0016...@0016yes.@0003
He refused to take even one step in retreat
from the advancing Grado soldiers.@0003
@0017But still@0016...@0016@0003
I mean, I@0016...@0016I would have thought no
less of him if he had fled.@0003
Even if he were no longer a brave king@0016...@0016
Still@0016...@0016@0003
I would be happier if he were still alive.@0003@0017@0017@0009Eirika@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I do understand you.@0003
Everyone would tell me of my parents'
bravery, of their honor@0016...@0016@0003
But I will never see them. I will
never know them for myself.@0003
Oh, what I would give if I could have
met them@0016...@0016just once.@0003@000CL'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0C5B
@000C@0010@0122@000CEirika@0016... @0016Please hold
for a moment.@0003@0009@0010@0102@0009What is it, L'Arachel?@0003@000CAbout what we were discussing earlier@0016...@0016@0003
I would not want you to get the wrong
idea.@0003
I was not saying I was lonely because
my parents were dead.@0003
I am not that weak, you know?@0003
I have never even@0016...@0016cried@0016...@0016when
thinking of my parents.@0003@0009@0017I know, L'Arachel.
You are a very strong person.@0003
We are lucky to have you with us.@0003@0017@0017@000CI hope you do not think this
all too sudden, but@0016...@0016@0003
Here. Look at this.@0003@0009@0017What's this@0016...?@0016@0003@0017@000CThis ruby has been in Rausten for
generations. It is a valuable gem.@0003
I would be honored if@0016... @0016I would
like for you to have it.@0003@0009What? No, I couldn't! It's
far too precious to accept@0016...@0016@0003@000CNo, I mean it. Please, accept
this as a gift.@0003
Here.@0003
I won't allow you to refuse.@0003@0009@0017L'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Thank you. I will treasure it.@0003
I so wish I had something to give
you in return@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou needn't feel that way.
Here, I've an idea@0016...@0016@0003
Once we've put an end to all the
monstrosities in our lands@0016...@0016@0003
Invite me to Renais. Does this
plan please you?@0003@0009Yes@0016...@0016certainly. Of course.@0003@000CThen we are agreed!@0003
Now, you had better not
go dying in battle on me.@0003
Not until then, at any rate.
Do I have your word?@0003@0009Yes@0016...@0016let us both live long
enough to look back on this time.@0003
I am sure that, when we do look back,
it will be as the best of friends.@0003
# 0x0C5C
@0017@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@012C@000CAh, Eirika.@0003
Shall we ride together a while?@0003@0009Tana, you seem well.@0003
And yes, I'd appreciate
the company.@0003@000C@0017I feel I should apologize.@0003
I'm afraid I haven't been very
much help to you, Eirika.@0003
To be honest, I'm still in training,
and not quite battle-ready.@0003
Perhaps you'd fare better if I were
not traveling with you@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Tana, that's not true at all.
You've been a great help to us.@0003
I have seen you in action. I know
what I'm talking about.@0003@000CThank you, Eirika.@0003
Heh@0016... @0016I feel so foolish now.@0003@0009Why is that?@0003@000CI look on you as a sister, Eirika.@0003
And yet, even though we're the same
age, you seem so much more mature.@0003@0009@0017Hardly@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CIt is you who even gave me the
courage to leave the castle.@0003
I wanted to be out on my own, like
you, to pattern my life after yours.@0003
I'm simply glad that we are friends.@0003@0009Me too, Tana.@0003
I'm glad you came. You help
to remind me of better times.@0003
# 0x0C5D
@0009@0010@012C@0009Oh, Brother@0016...@0016@0003
I'm going to get you
for this, Brother@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0010@0102@000CWhat's wrong, Tana?@0003
Has something happened
to Innes?@0003@0009My brother is so cruel!
Listen to what he said to me!@0003
He told me that I was just in
everyone's way@0016...@0016@0003
He said I should just go back
home to Frelia@0016...@0016@0003@000COh, dear@0016...@0016@0003@0009I'm so depressed.@0003
He's always like that, too.@0003
He just makes fun of me and
insults me and teases me.@0003
I hate him so much!@0003@000CTana, your brother has a strange
way of showing his concern@0016...@0016@0003
But he IS concerned about you.
You can see that, can't you?@0003@0009Yes, but@0016...@0016@0003@000CEven my brother gets angry at me when I
put myself at risk, even for a good cause.@0003
Your brother is harsh and rough of speech,
but he doesn't want you to get hurt.@0003@0009Well@0016... @0016I suppose
you're right.@0003@000C@0017Why don't we go speak with him later?@0003
I'll be right beside you.@0003@0017@0009Ah@0016...@0016all right.@0003
@0017But, Eirika@0016...@0016
I still envy you.@0003@0017@000CMe?@0003@0009@0017You and Ephraim as so close@0016...@0016@0003
You understand one another.
It must be@0016...@0016so nice@0017@0003
I wish my brother and I shared
that kind of connection.@0003@000CWell, we are twins, you know.@0003
I think that makes us slightly
different from normal siblings.@0003@0009@0017But you two never fight or
anything, do you?@0003
How do you two maintain such
a close relationship?@0003@0017@000CI@0016... @0016Well@0016...@0016@0003
Isn't that normal for twins?@0003
# 0x0C5E
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@012C@000CEirika, are you all right?@0003@0009@0017I am, thank you, Tana.@0003
I always feel better when
you're around.@0003@0017@000CI've been wondering@0016...@0016@0003
Eirika, do you think I've
grown stronger?@0003
I mean, stronger than when I was
cooped up in the castle at least?@0003@0009@0017Yes, of course you have.@0003@0017@000CReally?@0003@0009@0017Tana, you should have more
confidence in your abilities.@0003
If I had to rely on my own blade
alone, I would not survive.@0003
But with you around, I know I
can keep fighting.@0003@0017@000CYou think? I guess I'm
still not sure.@0003
@0017Still, it is nice to
hear you say that.@0003
Eirika, we'll get through
this, the two of us.@0003
And when we do, let's sit
together and just relax.@0003@0017@0017@0009Sure, Tana.@0003
But first, we'll have to
apologize to King Hayden.@0003@000C@0017Oh@0016...@0016@0003
Father@0016... @0016I wonder
if he's still mad.@0003@0017@0009Yes, you probably should.@0003@000C@0017Say, Eirika.
Could you@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Of course@0016... @0016I understand.@0003
You and I will speak to him
together. Don't you worry.@0003
# 0x0C5F
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@010F@000CEirika. I know this might
seem sudden, but@0016...@0016@0003
I've decided I must
protect you for a while.@0003@0009What?@0003
What do you mean by that?@0003@000CI was in a difficult situation
at Carcino.@0003
I@0016...@0016must admit that I owe you
much for your help that day.@0003@0009I@0016... @0016I see.@0003@000CSo now, I've decided to protect
you in battle.@0003
I don't know how to say this,
but@0016...@0016@0003
It is unacceptable that I
remain indebted to you.@0003@0009Oh, you and your fool pride@0016--@0016@0003@000CRegardless, you can count on me.@0003
No arrow can reach all enemies,
but I guarantee your safety.@0003
Will you accept my oath?@0003@0009Er@0016... @0016Sure.@0003
I accept.@0003
Thank you,
Prince Innes.@0003@000CFollow me, then.@0003@0009Uh, wait a moment, Innes.@0003
You're an archer@0016... @0016Wouldn't it make
more sense if you stayed behind me?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
# 0x0C60
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@010F@000C@0016...@0016What are you doing?@0003@0009What is it now, Innes?@0003@000C@0016...@0016I told you I was going
to protect you.@0003@0009Right.@0003@000CAnd yet, whenever an enemy shows
himself, you rush in and attack!@0003
@0016...@0016Everyone's going to think you're
the one protecting me.@0003@0009Well, I can't help you with your
image problems, Innes.@0003
You're an archer, while I have
to fight up close.@0003@000CThat is unacceptable.@0003
I said that I would protect you,
and I was being quite sincere.@0003@0009And I appreciate that.@0003
It's nice to know that, when
I cross swords with the enemy,@0003
you're never far from me, with
your bow close at hand.@0003@000CEirika@0016... @0016You are so kind@0016...@0016@0003
You're so different from that@0016...@0016
brother of yours.@0003@0009No, not as much as you think.@0003
Maybe you only see him as a
warrior, as competition,@0003
@0017but he is a fine and gentle
man, capable of great compassion.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016If you say so.@0003
I suppose I cannot doubt it
if it comes from your lips.@0003@0009@0017Prince Innes, please, try to
befriend my brother.@0003
I know he would want this as well.@0003
I don't know why you dislike him.  When
I am alone with him, he is so kind.@0003@0017@000CForgive me, but I can bear no more
of this talk.@0003
When I see you look that way, I feel
only jealousy for this Ephraim.@0003@0009What@0016--?@0016@0003@000CHe is@0016...@0016a hard man to forgive.@0003
Perhaps there is only one
way to settle this.@0003@0009Prince Innes@0016...?@0016@0003

@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@010F@000CEirika.@0003
Forgive the intrusion, but I
must speak to you at once.@0003@0009Prince Innes?
What is it?@0003@000CFirst, just listen to me.@0003
Is there@0016...@0016anyone who lays
claim to your heart?@0003@0009What?@0003
N-no@0016... @0016There's
nobody like that.@0003@000CI see. Then let me speak frankly.@0003
Eirika, it seems I have fallen in
love with you.@0003@0009Wh-what!?@0003
This is no place for jokes, Innes!
Why would you say something like that?@0003@000CThis is no joke.
I am absolutely serious.@0003
These feelings surprise me as
well. I don't know what to do.@0003
Fighting at your side all this time,
the emotion just exploded within me.@0003
I love you. I could not bear to
see you in the arms of another.@0003@0009P-Prince Innes!@0003
I@0016... @0016I@0016...@0016@0003@000CNo, Eirika.
Do not answer now.@0003
I have not yet bested Ephraim. I have
not earned the right to woo you.@0003@0009Wha@0016--? @0016Why are you bringing my
brother into this?@0003@000CWith a man like him around, I can see
why you show no interest in suitors.@0003
If I prove myself his superior, you
will surely accept my hand.@0003
If I fail, I release any claim to
your affection.@0003
@0017But I swear it on the depth of my
love that I will destroy that man.@0003
Eirika, I will expect your answer then.@0003
That's all I have to say.@0003@0017@000C@0011@0007@0009Innes!@0003
What an@0016...@0016infuriating man!@0003

in rare form today.@0003@000C@0010@0116@0017@000CAh, Princess! Yes, I'm trying
not to overextend myself today.@0003
I see you're looking well, too.@0003
@0017Except for@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009@0017Yes, Forde?@0005
What is it?@0003@0017@000CWell@0016... @0016I was just thinking
about something@0016...@0016@0003
Princess, do you find that your armor
leaves a bit too much@0016...@0016exposed?@0003@0009I beg your pardon?@0003@000CYou know, too exposed. Especially around
the@0016...@0016er@0016...@0016midriff, if you will.@0003
Aren't you worried that, in the heat
of battle, it might, eh@0016...@0016@0003@0009Fly up like this?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Augh!@0005
Oh@0016... @0016Uh@0016...@0016@0003
You were@0016...@0016just joking. Wow.
Don't scare me like that!@0003@0017@0009Oh, I'm sorry. That must have
seemed rather unladylike.@0003
Honestly, though, I do rather
like this armor.@0003
It's very easy to move around in.@0003
I think that freedom of movement is
far more important to me in combat.@0003@000CWell, sure. I guess everyone has
his own preference.@0003
I've gotten many long years of use
from my armor.@0003@0009I can imagine.@0003
@0017Now that I look at it, I can see
all the scars from all your fights.@0003@0017@0017@000CA knight's greatest pride are the scars
his armor bears for him.@0003
This battered shell of mine is the only
true badge of valor@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016The only real sign that I've weathered
blade and arrow for king and country.@0003@0009Forde@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Oh, and@0016... @0016Well, in my case@0016...@0016@0003
Some of these dents are from me falling
off my horse. Heh@0016...@0016@0003
Oh, and some come from falling asleep in
my armor and rolling onto my weapons.@0003
Kind of a lot of them, actually.
Heh@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0017@0009You stood by my brother when he
and I were separated, didn't you?@0003
I never got a chance to thank you.@0003@000COh, it was nothing. Really.@0003
To be fair, Ephraim probably saved
my hide more often than I his.@0003@0009I doubt that. My brother rushes into
battle without thought for consequence.@0003
I think, if nothing else, you restrained
his natural recklessness.@0003
I owe you a debt. Both you and Kyle.@0003@000CPrincess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003@0009Forde, Renais thanks you. May
you always stand beside us.@0003@000CAt your service, Princess.@0003

you fighting at my side again.@0003
It's only because of your skill
that I'm fighting here today.@0003@000CWell, we all seem to be deep
in this fight, milady@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yes, there's no pulling back now.@0003@000CSo it would seem. My lady, leave
the fighting to us soldiers.@0003
Even if there be an unholy hail of arrows,
we would ride into them for your sake.@0003@0009Ha ha@0016...@0016@0005 Why, thank you, sir knight!@0003@0015@0006@0009@0016...@0016Say, Forde.@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009What will you do when all
this fighting is over?@0003@000CWhen the fighting is over?@0005
Hm@0016... @0016Good question.@0003
Well@0016...@0016@0003
I suppose I'll return to Renais@0016...@0016
and take a very, very long nap.@0003@0009That does sound like you.
And then?@0003@000CThen? I would like to return
to my painting, I think.@0003@0009You paint?@0003@000CYes, milady. I paint.@0003
In the past, I've tried to be quiet
about this little hobby of mine.@0003
However, quite a few of our group
have unearthed my hidden secret.@0003@0009Is that so? Well, I'd love to
view your work sometime.@0003@000CAh, I'd be honored.@0003
It's hardly worthy of such an audience,
but I'd be glad to show it to you.@0003@0009I look forward to it.@0003
Oh!@0005
And@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009Would you ever consider@0016...@0016
doing a portrait of me?@0003@000C@0017I'm sorry?@0003@0017@0009Is that distasteful to you?@0003@000C@0017No! No@0016...@0016@0003
It's just that I so
rarely do portraits.@0003@0017@0009So, it would be a bother?@0003@000CNot at all! A bother? Really.@0003
This request comes from my princess.
I'd be more than happy to.@0003@0009Thank you, Forde.@0003

do when all this fighting ended@0016...@0016@0003@0009I remember@0016...@0016@0003@000CWell, I should have asked you, too.@0003

@0016...@0016@0003
I'd like to restore Renais and bring
happiness back to her people.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Princess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003@0009It is not enough that this war
end@0016...@0016that we go home again.@0003
It's not enough that my brother
become king.@0003
These things aren't enough to
make a good country.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0005@0009People deserve happiness. They are
the reason that we rule.@0003
Without the people, there can be
no Renais.@0003@000CTo live happily, to be proud
of our nation@0016...@0016@0003
To restore the happiness
of her people@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Yes, that is my dream now.@0003
It is an abstract goal, and 
perhaps a little vague, but@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CNo, not at all!@0003@0009How so?@0003@000CI mean, rebuilding a country, now
THAT is an abstract goal.@0003
But what you've described, that
is a wonderful ambition.@0003
I've never been so proud to
serve the kingdom of Renais.@0003@0009Forde@0016...@0016@0003@000CI've come to a decision!
@0017I know I've already sworn an oath, but@0016...@0016@0003
I want to renew that vow. Please, let
me help make your dream come true!@0003
I'll do anything I can to help you@0016...@0016as
long as it doesn't require heavy lifting.@0003@0017@0017@0009Thank you@0016...@0016
I'm very grateful to you, Forde.@0003
It feels like this war might never end,
and our people give in to despair quickly.@0003
But thanks to people like you, who smile
in the face of sorrow, they can be saved.@0003@000COh, no. You make too much of it.
I'm nothing special.@0003
I simply cannot allow myself to worry
when there's fighting to be done.@0003
You're the special one. You have such
a profound effect on us all.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Me? How so?@0003@0017@000CIt is because of you that we can go on.@0003
You and the prince are here, risking
your lives for the cause.@0003
Your guidance, your leadership@0016... @0016It
gives us a reason to live as well.@0003@0009@0017A reason@0016...@0016to live?@0003@0017@000CYes@0016... @0016To restore that radiant
smile to your own lovely face.@0003@0009@0017Oh!@0003@0017@000CI fight to see you smile again, to
drive the worry from your face.@0003
If I can do that, then I will be more
than happy to paint your portrait.@0003@0009Forde@0016...@0016@0003@000CWe'll do it together. Every day is
another step closer to the end of war.@0003
One step closer to making your dream
come true.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Agreed!@0003

@0016...@0016Oh, I'm sorry, Princess Eirika.@0003@0009@0017It's all right.
Were you@0016...@0016praying?@0003@0017@000CNot exactly. It's
called Valega.@0003@0009Valega?@0003@000CYes.@0003@0009What is it?@0003
Is it something to do with
Caer Pelyn's cultural history?@0003@000CYes, in a sense. Think of it as
a kind of wish. A very pure wish.@0003
It is a wish that expands far
beyond individual desire.@0003@0009I see. I don't claim to understand, but
@0017it sounds very interesting.@0003
If you don't mind, I'd like to
hear more about it later.@0003@0017@000CIf you like.@0003@0009@0017Yes, I would.@0003@0017

@0017@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0120@0009Master Saleh.@0003@000C@0017Princess.@0003@0017@0009What you were telling me about
Valega was most enlightening.@0003
It sounds as though you align your
desires with the world around you.@0003
By knowing the vastness of creation
around you, you come to know yourself.@0003
And then, by transcending your selfish
needs, you wish for a better world.@0003
What you told me, it helped me rediscover
the importance of that unselfish wish.@0003
It's the reason for the war we fight
now@0016... @0016The dream of a better world.@0003
Because of your Valega, my own
conviction was renewed.@0003@000C@0017Ahhh. I'm glad to hear that.
@0016...@0016@0003
Princess Eirika, you remind me of
the warrior princess, Nada Kuya.@0003@0017@0017@0009Nada Kuya?@0003@000CShe's one of Caer Pelyn's
ancient heroes.@0003@0009I'd like to hear about her.@0003@000CI've been told she was a strong
woman, beautiful and proud.@0003
She spoke with the voice of nature,
and she lived at one with the earth.@0003@0009But you called her a battle princess@0016...?@0016@0003@000CWell, in ancient times, Caer Pelyn
was invaded by a foreign nation.@0003@0009Really?@0003@000CAnd leading the charge against the
invaders was Nada Kuya.@0003
She carried a narrow sword made from a
fang gifted to her by the dragonkin.@0003
With her dragon blade in her hand,
she drove Caer Pelyn's enemies away.@0003@0009Wow@0016... @0016Quite a story.@0005
And you think I@0016--@0016@0003@000CYes. You remind me of her.@0003@0009No, no@0016...@0016@0003
When Grado invaded Renais, I was
paralyzed. I couldn't do anything.@0003
It is only because of the sacrifices
of others that I could even escape.@0003@000CBut now, you are here. With
your strength, courage, and dignity.@0003@0009Master Saleh@0016...@0016@0003@000CIf you achieve victory, the
legend will become reality.@0003
You will become the Nada Kuya
of this age.@0003@0009I see@0016...@0016@0017 Yes, I see!@0003
I have a reason to fight.
I have things to protect.@0003
I fight for the future. The future
of Renais, the future of my people.@0003
Thank you, Master Saleh.@0003
Your stories always give me the
courage to fight on.@0003@0017@0017@000CI'm glad to hear that.@0003@0009I pray your wisdom guides
us through this war.@0003@000CI will do what I can.@0003

What troubles you, Princess Eirika?@0003@0009@0017Oh, Master Saleh.@0003
No, nothing. My mind was
somewhere else@0016...@0016@0003
Oh, and in the middle of
a battle@0016... @0016I'm sorry.@0003@0017@000CDon't be sorry.@0003
I am not going to judge you
for how you think or act.@0003@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
@0016...@0016@0005
I was just remembering my home.@0003
I was thinking about the last
time Renais was at peace.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017There were the most beautiful
mountains, the clearest rivers@0016...@0016@0003
The scent of wildflowers filled the
air. The sky was clear and bright.@0003
This was before war scarred the
hills and scorched the skies.@0003
It was a wonderful place. Every day
was filled with hope and possibility.@0003
My brother and I would go hunting
with Prince Lyon.@0003
@0016...@0016I would make lunches for us. Ephraim
would tease, but Lyon was happy.@0003@0002
I@0016... @0016I miss that time so very much.@0003@0017@000CPrincess Eirika@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I give you my word that you will once
again see the Renais you love restored.@0003@0009Master Saleh@0016...@0016
@0017I do hope so.@0003
But first, you and I must concentrate
on the battle at hand. We must win.@0003
Thank you, Master Saleh.@0003@0002
Your homeland, Caer Pelyn, was also
a most beautiful place.@0003@0017@0017@000CWe had nothing special. But, because of
that, we had@0016...@0016everything.@0003@0009I didn't understand that before.@0003
Now, I think I know what you mean.@0003@000CI am glad.@0003@0009When we have to fight no more, please,
let me visit you in Caer Pelyn.@0003
I would like to know more about your
home. About Valega and Nada Kuya.@0003@000CYou are welcome anytime. Caer Pelyn
and I will welcome you with open arms.@0003

You charged at the enemy line
after you were injured, didn't you?@0003@0009Oh, that? That was nothing.
Don't worry about it.@0003@000CIt's not the injury I'm worried about. You're
not supposed to do things like that!@0003@0009If I retreat at the first scratch,
command will fall apart.@0003@000CMy lord, you are the future of
Renais, the commander of this army.@0003
If something were to happen to you,
morale would be shattered.@0003
We would lose this war. All because
of your misplaced pride.@0003@0009Fine, Kyle. I'll hang back and
let you knights lead the charge.@0003
But I don't have time to talk
about this now. I'm leaving.@0003@0009@0011@0006@000CHe says he's going to stop being
so reckless, but I know better.@0003
I have to stop him before
he gets himself killed@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0C69
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0118@000CDo you remember what we agreed to
last time we talked, Prince Ephraim?@0003@0009Sigh. High command must remain behind
the vanguard and let the soldiers fight.@0003
And if he tries to take the van, any
unit, regardless of rank, may stop him.@0003@000CYes, exactly. So you
do remember it.@0003@0009And now, every time I try to lead
the charge, my own men stop me!@0003
They waste themselves worrying about
my safety when their own is at risk.@0003
Look, I agreed to your plan at the
time, but this is just ridiculous.@0003
I'm going to revoke the order.@0003@000CNo, Prince! I know I've told you
this before@0016...@0016@0003
But you have to remember, you're
the future of Renais@0016--@0016@0003@0009And if we fail because I do not
join the battle, we have no future!@0003
I do know I bear much responsibility,
but I simply must revoke the command.@0003@000CI'm sorry, Prince Ephraim, but I
can't allow you to do that.@0003
I'm going back to the fight. Make
sure you hang back, sire. Go on.@0003@000C@0011@0006@0009@0016...@0016Sigh@0016... @0016That blasted Kyle.@0003@0002
I know that he's simply concerned
about me.@0003
@0017Come to think of it, he's always
been like that.@0003
I can't recall a moment when he HASN'T
been overly worried about me.@0003
@0017But that order really needs to go.@0003

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0118@000CMy lord prince@0016...@0016
I must apologize.@0003@0009Why is that, Kyle? What do
you need to apologize for?@0003@000CThe other day, I was injured on
the battlefield.@0003
You raced to my side without a
moment's hesitation.@0003
As I lost consciousness, I heard
you say something I won't forget.@0003
Treat this man as you would my own
brother. Help him, regardless of cost.@0003@0009And why must you apologize for that?@0003@000CI ought to have been the one riding
to your aid, my lord.@0003
And that you would consider a lowborn
knight like myself a brother@0016...@0016@0003
All these years, I've thought of myself
as nothing but a loyal retainer.@0003
I failed to understand that our
bond runs deeper.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Since I was a child, you've
taught me how to be a warrior.@0003
A prince is raised to be detached.
Distant. To rule the people from above.@0003
I could not afford to feel any real
affection for anyone. Just Seth, Forde@0016...@0016@0003
And you, Kyle.
You were the only ones.@0003
I realize that much separates us,
but I still consider you family.@0003
Although@0016...@0016you do worry about me too much.
And you have to stop snapping at me.@0003@0017@000CPrince Ephraim, when I was injured the
other day, I came to a realization.@0003
I was wrong. The decision I made you
agree to the other day was wrong.@0003
You belong on the front lines, like
any of the noble warriors of Renais.@0003
It will do the men's morale good to
see you fighting at their side.@0003
@0017From now on, fight as you must!@0003
I will be beside you, and I will
protect you as you fight at our side.@0003@0017@0017@0009Thank you, Kyle. I was so caught in
my worry that I couldn't fight well.@0003
And I will make a concession to
you as well.@0003
I will not be so reckless anymore.
I know I have an important position.@0003
Are we in agreement, Kyle?@0003@000CWe are, my lord.
Let's ride on together!@0003@0009Sounds good. Kyle@0016...@0016

Pay less attention to me and more
to our enemies!@0003@0017@0009No, no, Forde. Give it up.
Come on@0016--@0016let me see it.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Fine.@0003@0009@0016...@0016What is that?
Is that a painting?@0003@000C@0017This? No, no@0016... @0016No, it's
a topographic map! Yes.@0003
For strategy. We need to plot
out our strategy, don't we?@0003
During battles, I like to look at
this map and analyze enemy lines@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009But@0016...@0016that's clearly a
landscape painting.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009Did you paint this?@0003@000C@0017Er@0016... @0016Yes. A long time ago.@0003@0017@0017@0009This is impressive, Forde. You're good
with both a sword and a brush!@0003
You know, when Eirika and I were young,
we'd sneak out for long horse rides.@0003
We used to watch the sunset sink behind
the mountains while we talked for hours.@0003
Your painting reminds me of those days.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
Prince Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017But@0016...@0016during a battle probably isn't
the right place to indulge your hobby.@0003
What if something happened to you?@0003@0017@0017@000C@0017I'm no fool, Prince Ephraim. I always
stay alert on the battlefield.@0003

in a battle.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Yes, but only in battle.@0003
Next to Franz, you seem like
you're always half asleep.@0003@0017@000CYou surely understand how difficult it
is to be compared with one's siblings.@0003
Next to you, the princess seems so
kind and thoughtful. And caring, too!@0003@0009@0017I see your point. Yes, it's rough

lead my people back from this disaster.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016I think I understand what you
mean, Prince.@0003
When we lost our parents, I was shattered.
Franz helped me get back on my feet.@0003
If I didn't have his help then, I don't
know where I'd be today@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017We are who we are now because they
have always stood by us.@0003
@0017@0016...@0016Let's end this war quickly, Forde.
For them. Especially for them.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Yes.@0003

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0116@0009How are you doing, Forde?@0003@0017@000CMe? Oh, I'm fine as long as I've
got a sword in my hand.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Oh, by the way, Forde.@0003
When you have some time, would you
@0017show me your painting again?@0003@000CYou'd like to see it? Why
the sudden interest, Prince?@0003@0009@0017The scene you painted, it's the
Renais we once knew@0016...@0016@0003
Those magnificent fields and tranquil
farming villages@0016...@0016@0003
@0017When I look at it, I can forget, for
a second, that we're on a battlefield.@0003
@0017I want to restore the Renais you painted.@0003
I want to restore these landscapes that
fill me with joy looking at them.@0003
I wanted to see the painting again so
that I could carry it with me in my heart.@0003@0017@000CIf you like it, Prince Ephraim, I'd
be honored if you would take it.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Really? Are you sure, Forde?@0003@0017@000CYes, of course. Please take it.@0003@0009Thank you, Forde! It is truly beautiful.
@0016...@0016Did you study painting?@0003@000CNo. I just@0016... @0016When we were young,
I would paint for Franz.@0003
@0016...@0016Our father spent much time away, and
Franz wept every night, missing him.@0003
But I was just a child, too. I didn't
know how to make him stop crying.@0003
One day, I showed him a drawing that
I'd made of our parents@0016...@0016@0003
And Franz stopped crying. I've been
painting ever since@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016I see@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016I've a thought@0016... @0016In exchange for this
painting, there's something you can do.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016What is it, Forde?@0003@0017@000COnce you've achieved your goal, once you've
restored Renais to the way it was@0016...@0016@0003
Can I have a vacation?@0003@0009Is rest all you ever think about? If
you want that vacation, earn it!@0003@000CRight, right. @0017I'll just keep risking
my life protecting you then, Ephraim.@0003@0017@0009You do that. I'm counting
on you, Forde.@0003

You're still so young. Don't push
yourself too hard today, all right?@0003@0017@000CI won't@0016...@0016@0003
I have a favor to ask.
Do you have time for me?@0003@0009What is it, Myrrh?@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Don't be nervous, Myrrh.
You can ask me anything.@0003@0017@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003
May I call you@0016...@0016
brother?@0003@0009Wha@0016... @0016What?@0003
Myrrh@0016...@0016
What's come over you?@0003@000C@0016...@0016I was watching you and
Eirika together.@0003
You looked so close.@0003@0009Of course we're close. She is
my sister, after all.@0003@000CI envy her.@0003
I@0016...@0016wish that I had
a brother like you.@0003
That's why I ask@0016...@0016
Even if just for this journey@0016...@0016@0003
Please be my brother.@0003@0009I don't know what to say@0016...@0016@0003
I wasn't expecting you to
ask anything like that@0016...@0016@0003@000CNo@0016...?@0016@0003
I'm sorry. I should
not have asked@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh@0016... @0016No, Myrrh@0016... @0016Wait.@0003
@0017I'm not saying no.@0003@0017@000CSo, it's all right?@0003@0009Uhhh@0016... @0016Sure.@0003
@0017Of course.@0006
If it will make you happy.@0003@0017@000C@0017Yes@0016... @0016It does.@0003
I'll come speak with you
again soon@0016...@0016Brother.@0003@0017@000C@0011@0006@0009Oh, my@0016...@0016@0003
Eirika@0016... @0016Myrrh@0016...@0016@0003
How can I say no to that look?@0003
I guess sisters are my weakness.@0003
# 0x0C6F
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0126@000C@0017Hello@0016...@0016Big Brother.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0003
Myrrh, don't you find that
to be a little awkward?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Is it?@0003@0009I mean@0016...@0016
@0017You're a dragon, correct?@0003
And if I'm right, you're also
far older than I am@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000C@0017That's correct@0016...@0016@0003
So, should I be your big sister?@0003@0017@0009@0017Well, that doesn't seem right, either.@0003
You look so much younger than
I do. That would be odd@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CI am@0016...@0016very old.@0003
Perhaps mother?
I@0016...@0016don't like grandmother.@0003@0009@0080@001D@0009@0016...@0016Let's not dwell on this.
Sister will be fine.@0003
@0009@0080@001C@0009Well. Did you have something
you wanted to ask me?@0003@0017@000CI did@0016...@0016@0003
You see, Brother, I have
a favor to ask of you.@0003@0009Yes?@0003@000CIn the forest@0016...@0016I was always
with my father.@0003
Even when I slept, he was there,
watching over me.@0003@0009Yes?@0003@000CSo@0016...@0016Brother.@0003
Would you@0016...@0016stay with me at
night and watch over me?@0003@0009@0017No!@0003
@0017Myrrh, I understand your insecurity,
but this simply is not acceptable.@0003
Especially when we are on the march.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh, don't look so sad.@0003@0002
@0017When you see Eirika next,
why don't you ask her?@0003
I'm sure she will agree.@0003
If you and I are brother and sister, then
surely you and she are sisters, too.@0003
How does that sound?@0003@0017@0017@000CYes@0016... @0016I'll do that.@0003
Thank you, Brother.@0003

@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0126@0009Hey, Myrrh@0016...@0016@0003
When this war is over@0016...@0016
What will you do?@0003
Have you thought about
where you will go?@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003
I've lived in Darkling Woods
ever since I was a child.@0003
I think that I shall spend
the rest of my life there.@0003@0009On your own?@0003
Do you have anyone waiting
for you in the forest?@0003@000CI@0016...@0016
I am on my own now.@0003
But you need not worry.
I am a dragon, after all.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
I've been thinking, Myrrh.@0003
If you would like, you can
live with us in Renais.@0003@000CWhat?@0003@0009When this war is over@0016... @0016When
we restore peace to Magvel@0016...@0016@0003
Eirika and I will be going back
to Renais to lead our people.@0003
Would you like to live in the
castle? With us?@0003@000COh, but@0016...@0016@0003
I would not want to
inconvenience you.@0003@0009@0017It's nothing you need worry about.
Castle Renais is a vast place.@0003
I'm sure we could spare a room for
a small girl like you.@0003
And besides, you are my sister, right?@0003
Family should stay together,
don't you think?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003
But@0016...@0016you must not forget
that I am a dragon.@0003
I must think about it.@0003
I would love to, but@0016...@0016
perhaps I shouldn't, and so@0016...@0016@0003
I must think about it.@0003@0009As you wish.@0003@000C@0017But@0016...@0016@0003
Thank you for the offer.
It makes me very happy.@0003
Thank you, Brother.@0003@0017

Why are you here? Do you
not have somewhere to be?@0003@0009I'm sorry?@0005
What do you mean?@0003@000CWhy don't you go fight someone or
break down a wall or something?@0003@0009We all have our roles to play in this
battle. I'm waiting for the right moment.@0003@000CAre you speaking honestly with me?@0003
Are you not simply making an excuse so
that you have time to chat with me?@0003@0009@0016...@0016There's no glory in dragging
out a war without good reason.@0003@000CIt does me good to hear that.@0003
If you or any of your good men are
injured, come to me at once.@0003
I'll wait for you here, and I'll
heal your wounds swiftly.@0003@0017@0009Yes, well, that's why you're here,
isn't it? We're counting on you.@0003
We fight with confidence only
because we have your healing skills.@0003@000CNaturally!@0003
And today, I will serve you as
well as I can, as always.@0003
Watch for me!@0003@000C@0011@0007@0009@0017She seems so reliable@0016...@0016
and SO assertive!@0003

all like that?@0003@0017

about you from so many people.@0003
I thought it best to ask directly:
You are a reckless man, are you not?@0003
It seems an attitude unbefitting
a commander, wouldn't you say?@0003@0009Don't speak to me that way.@0003
If I can save a life by taking
a risk myself, I'll do it.@0003
This is war, and war is risky.
I have no problem with that.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Oh, dear.@0003
I'll bet your body is just covered
with scars under that armor, isn't it?@0003
I can heal them all for you.
Let me see them.@0003@0009Thanks.
@0017Let's see@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0015@0006@000C@0080@000E@000COh!@0003
Oh@0016... @0016Oh my!@0003
Wh-what are you doing?@0003@0009I have to take my armor off if I'm going
to show you the scar on my shoulder@0016--@0016@0003@000CCad! Beast! Pervert! Devil!@0003
I simply will NOT allow you to take
advantage of me in my confused state!@0003@0009Conf@0016-- @0016What!?@0003
Wait, L'Arachel!
What about my scars@0016...?@0016@0003

You don't have to be so defensive.
Why don't you come talk to me?@0003@000D@0016...@0016That depends. You're not going
to try to attack me again, are you?@0003
You won't go ripping the armor from
your@0016...@0016well-toned body, will you?@0003@0009L'Arachel@0016... @0016That was all just
a simple misunderstanding.@0003
But I apologize if I offended your
sensibilities in removing my armor.@0003@000D@0080@000E@000C@0017Well, I suppose I can forgive you
for this one indiscretion.@0003
I wasn't prepared. I've never seen
a man's naked body before@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Naked@0016... @0016I was only showing you the
scar on my shoulder, like you asked!@0003@000CA naked shoulder is a big deal!@0003
I was so shocked. Why, I could
hardly sleep at all that night!@0003@000C@0080@001E@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0016...?@0016@0003
What's wrong, L'Arachel?
You seem different somehow.@0003@000C@0080@001C@000CN-no. Everything is fine@0016...@0016@0003
Please don't look at me in such
a vulgar, leering way.@0003
I find it very inappropriate.@0003@0009Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
I certainly would never@0016--@0016@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CWhat!?@0003
Are you saying that you do
not find me attractive?@0003@0009No! I@0016... @0016What do you want me to say?@0003@000CHow can you be so calm at a time like
this? Don't you see what you've done!?@0003
Ahhhh! I'm so frustrated!@0003
Don't you ever forget this, Ephraim!@0003
I hope that, someday, some girl comes
along and gets YOU all rattled, too!@0003@000C@0011@0007@0009@0016...@0016I just do NOT get her.@0003
@0017She is rather cute, though.@0003@0017

@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0114@000CDuessel, can we speak?@0003@0009Oh, Prince Ephraim.
Of course, my friend.@0003@000CI feel I should apologize for making
you side against Grado in this.@0003@0009Bah. What nonsense!@0003
Please, use me however you
would to end this war.@0003@000CI want you to know how honored I am
to fight at your side again.@0003
@0017Show me a little of your skill with
the spear, like when you taught me.@0003@0017@0009Hmm@0016...@0016@0003
Ephraim, your skills have grown
significantly since then.@0003
Why, the first time I met you,
you could hardly hold a spear!@0003
I couldn't even bring myself to lie
and say you weren't THAT bad!@0003@000C@0016...@0016There's no need to be cruel!
I realize how helpless I was then.@0003@0009Let me finish! Even then, your strong
will was most impressive.@0003
On your first day wielding a spear,
you chose to challenge ME!@0003
I remember how enthusiastic your attack
was. You were determined to win.@0003
But@0016...@0016you were destined to lose that
day. Still, I was quite shocked.@0003
You weren't trying to learn my skill.
You were trying to steal it from me!@0003
And I thought an apprentice was
supposed to be obedient to his master.@0003@000CWhen you fight, you must respect your
opponent, not obey him.@0003
@0016...@0016Besides, you knocked me out
so quickly, I hardly touched you.@0003@0009I never dreamed of testing my skills
against a prince of Renais.@0003
After that match, though@0016...@0016
Oh, I changed my mind.@0003
@0017I knew it would be interesting to teach
my skills to someone like you.@0003@0017@000CNow, you're the one speaking nonsense!@0003
Ah, I know@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Let's duel again after this battle!@0003
I'm older now, better trained.
I'm sure I can beat you this time.@0003@0017@0017@0009Hmmm@0016... @0016Yes, fine.@0003
I'd like to see if you've been
keeping up with your training.@0003

just now? You looked distracted.@0003
I wonder, was it the wrong decision
to send you fighting against Grado?@0003@000C@0016...@0016You've no need to worry. My reasons
for leaving Grado are my own.@0003
It doesn't matter who I'm fighting.
My resolve won't be weakened.@0003@0009That is good to hear@0016...@0016
Actually, I'm here for a rematch.@0003
I have no idea how you beat me last
time, but this time, I can do it!@0003@000CHmm. It looks like you haven't
learned your lesson yet.@0003
You know, they used to call me Obsidian.
I was one of the Imperial Three.@0003
I'm not about to let a young punk
like you best me at the spear!@0003
# 0x0C76
@0009@0010@0114@000C@0010@0125@0009Phew@0016...@0016@0003@000CNicely done, Ephraim.@0003
There's nothing left for
me to teach you, it seems.@0003@0017@0009That's utter nonsense. I still have
much to learn from you, Duessel.@0003
I intend to be the greatest
spearman Magvel has ever known.@0003
I gave up on swords after seeing
how they fare against spears.@0003
Sword, axe, spear, bow@0016...@0016and
even magic. I've seen them all.@0003
The spear always comes out on top. And
I want mine to be the best spear around.@0003@000CHm@0016... @0016That's a bold statement.@0003
But you may yet be the one who
can prove it true, lad.@0003@0009@0016...@0016I thank you, Duessel.@0003
It's only because of the skills you
gave me that I'm alive and here now.@0003
Our countries were friends, but you
taught me like family@0016...@0016@0003@000CI am a warrior. All I can do is improve
my skills and pass them on to a student.@0003
And if you best me using the skills
that I taught you, well@0016...@0016@0003
That's just the nature of war.
The young surpass the old.@0003
@0017And I am glad to be fighting at the
side of such a worthy student.@0003@0017@0017@0009Duessel@0016...@0016@0003@000CI know that I've been branded a
traitor. I'm prepared for that.@0003
But I do have one regret@0016...@0016@0003
I regret that I betrayed my
emperor@0016...@0016@0003@0009You never betrayed him.@0003
You remain as loyal to him now
as when you swore your oaths.@0003
No, it is Grado who has betrayed
the ideals it once held dear.@0003@0002
And now, as then, you are my
teacher. Nothing has changed.@0003

you are the last true man of Grado.@0003@000CEphraim@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Hm@0016... @0016Yes. A student should not
inspire his teacher.@0003
Ephraim. Be strong. Remain true.@0003
Believe in yourself, and act in
accordance with your beliefs.@0003
@0016...@0016No matter what happens,
be a strong king.@0003@0017@0017@0009Yes, you needn't worry about that.@0003
Such has been my intention since
the day I first held this spear.@0003
No matter what the future holds@0016...@0016
I'm never going to change.@0003
I will let my faith and my beliefs

I'm so glad to see you.@0003@0017@0009Tana, you should pull back to
a safer location.@0003
What would we do if you were
attacked by archers?@0003@000C@0017But@0016...@0016I want to go

I feel safer when I'm
close to you, Ephraim.@0003@0017@0009I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
protect you if I get into a duel.@0003
I have to focus on fighting our
enemies.@0003@000COh, no@0016... @0016Please, Ephraim, don't
speak to me like that.@0003
I've trained with Frelia's finest
pegasus knights. I can fight, too!@0003@0009But@0016...@0016@0003@000CI'm sorry if I've been following

when we first met?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Ah, of course! It was at Castle
Frelia, wasn't it?@0003
Eirika and I had been invited to visit
for your birthday celebration.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000COh, I'm so glad you remembered!@0003@0009King Hayden seemed so delighted
that we'd come to visit.@0003
I think that was the first time
I met Innes, too.@0003@000CSo, Ephraim, what did you think
of the dress I was wearing?@0003@0009I@0016... @0016Hm@0016...@0016@0003
I'm sorry, but I don't think I got
a good look at it at the time.@0003
Perhaps you don't remember, but as soon
as I arrived, Innes challenged me.@0003
We ended up having an archery match
right when the party began.@0003
I think Innes won that match.@0003@000CDo you remember my hair?
I was so happy with it!@0003@0009@0017Your@0016...@0016hair? Uh@0016...@0016@0003
Well, right after our archery match,
Innes challenged me to the spear.@0003
@0017I think I won that match!@0003@000C@0017I'll bet you don't even remember
what I said afterward!@0003@0017@0009Er, Innes can be persistent. After
spears, we moved on to jousting.@0003
That time, I think it was@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000COh, you! You only remember what
happened with my brother!@0003
You don't care about me at all,
do you!?@0003@0009Oh, no, no! That's not true.
It's just@0016...@0016@0003@000CFine! Why should I care about you when you
can't even be bothered to care about me?@0003
You just keep having fun with my brother
and don't pay me any mind at all!@0003@000C@0011@0009Tana, wait a minute! Hey!
Don't go off on your own!@0003

So, uh, what can I do for you?@0003@000CEirika helped me prepare lunch. I haven't
tried it yet, but I'm sure it's delicious.@0003
Would you like to eat with me?@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Tana. This is a battlefield.@0003

What's the matter with you?@0003
You've been acting so odd
lately.@0003@000CYes, I am acting funny. And it's
all your fault, Ephraim!@0003
Whenever I try to talk to you,
you always keep your distance!@0003

you never open up to me.@0003@0009That's not true@0016...@0016@0003@000CIs there someone else?@0003@0009What@0016...?@0016@0003@000CIt's just@0016...@0016@0003
You never pay any attention
to me. You never have@0016...@0016@0003
It makes me so sad.@0003

you more and more.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Tana, you're still just a

me like that@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017No, I meant it as a compliment.@0003
Because you're so young, your words
have such a simple, honest purity@0016...@0016@0003
I do appreciate your affection.@0003@0017@0017@000C@0017Ephraim@0016...@0016@0003

time for me, so we can chat?@0003@0009Yes@0016...@0016of course.@0003
But we don't have the luxury to
stop and chat on the battlefield.@0003
We have an obligation to end this

holding up?@0003@000CFine. I may be young, but I'm every

You know, you're looking much
improved from when we set out.@0003@000CHm. Do you really think
so, General?@0003@0009Oh, definitely. You seem much more sure
of yourself. All doubt has left your face.@0003
By the time you reach my age, you'll be
the finest spear- and swordsman around.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CHonestly? Sir, do you
really believe that?@0003@0009@0016...@0016I do@0016...@0016

you're getting better and better.@0003
Your parry is a little stiff, but
you are clearly improving.@0003@000CAre you serious? Do you
really think so, sir?@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Why is it that, when I compliment

I mean, you're General Seth, the
Silver Knight. You're my hero.@0003@0009Hahaha@0016...@0016
No more flattery, Franz. Please.@0003@000CBut, General, it's true!@0003@000C@0080@000D@000BDo you remember when Grado's forces
overran Castle Renais?@0003
Despite grave injuries, you outcharged
the enemy, broke their lines, and escaped.@0003
And then, you delivered the princess,
on your own, to Frelia safely.@0003
If I were you, I doubt I could have
survived such a challenge@0016...@0016@0003
You are the only person I know who can
make impossible feats possible.@0003@0009What pressure you put on me! How
can I possibly fail now?@0003
You would lose all faith in me!
Ah, but, Franz, you're still young.@0003
You will grow into a remarkable
warrior, I have no doubt.@0003
Be confident. I'm counting on you.
Train your mind and hone your skills.@0003@000BReally? Do you really
think so, General?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Franz@0016...@0016
That's enough.@0003@000B@0080@000E@000COh, right! Sorry, sir!@0003@0017@0009All right, back into the

How are you, sir?@0003
@0017I'm so honored that you
came to talk to me.@0003@0009Must you always overreact?@0003
@0016...@0016Honestly, Franz@0016...@0016
I'm the one who should feel honored.@0003@000C@0017I beg your pardon?@0005
What do you mean, sir?@0003@0017@0009When I was just a squire, there was one
knight whom I admired above all others.@0003
His skill with sword and spear was
legendary. He was truly peerless.@0003
We squires learned the meaning of
chivalry watching him serve the king.@0003@0002
@0017Ten years back, we received word that an
infamous assassin was hiding in Renais.@0003
This knight hunted him down in secrecy
so as not to alert the assassin.@0003
He hounded the villain and killed
him, but he was mortally wounded@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0017@000CTen years ago? But that's when@0016--!?@0016@0003@0015@000C@0080@000E@000CNo, it couldn't be@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Yes, Franz.@0003
It was the greatest knight in the
history of Renais. Your father.@0003@0017@0017@000C@0016...@0016I was so young when my father died.@0003
And our mother passed away before he did.
Forde and I were almost always alone.@0003
Oh, I remember how I used to cry like a
babe about my father being gone so much.@0003
Forde would always remind me, He is serving
the royal family to protect Renais.@0003
Forde was so proud of our father, but he
was also a little bit sad.@0003
I remember a deep scar he had on his
shoulder, probably in battle.@0003
My brother and I used to climb up his
shoulders and vie for his attention.@0003
I grew up hearing what a great knight he
was, but I remember only his shoulder.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016You probably have no idea how
much you resemble your father.@0003
Your swordplay, how you tilt the lance,
your loyalty to Renais@0016...@0016@0003
You've certainly inherited your
father's spirit.@0003
It is an honor to see the skill I once
idolized developing in you, his son.@0003@000C@0017I@0016...@0016I am so flattered to hear that.
Thank you very much, General.@0003
@0017Someday, I will become a knight even
greater than my brother or my father.@0003
To restore Renais, the kingdom to which
I've sworn my blade, I will fight on!@0003@0009Thank you, Franz. Let's do the best we
can. For Renais, and for your father.@0003@000CYes, General!@0003

way to go. I've lost so much time.@0003@000CSir Garcia@0016...@0016@0003@0009No, no honorifics. I gave up my title
years ago so I could raise my son.@0003

focused on proving myself in battle.@0003

times, he did.@0003@0009His Majesty always watched over us.@0003
Hardworking soldiers received words of
praise to drive them to greater glories.@0003

giving them a reason to improve@0016...@0016@0003
He was a great king. He earned the trust

all my time as a knight@0016...@0016@0003

you for King Fado's death.@0003

You're from Grado, and we've seen the
treacheries of which they are capable.@0003
But I've watched you, and I know now
that I was wrong.@0003
@0017I'm grateful for the kindness and
compassion that you've showed us all.@0003
My men are right. You are a healing
spirit, sent to rejuvenate us all.@0003
We're fortunate to have you as our
friend.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016Friend@0016...?@0016@0003@000C@0017More than a friend. You are an
irreplaceable asset to our cause.@0003@0017@0009Oh, my@0016...@0016
I'm sorry@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016Please, return to the battle.
And may you be guided to safety.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Sister Natasha@0016...@0016@0003
If I am injured, I will not be reckless.
I will race to your side.@0003
And I know that you will take care
of me when that happens.@0003@0009Y-yes, of course I will!
Oh, but@0016...@0016I hope that it doesn't.@0003

@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0104@0009General Seth.@0003@000CSister Natasha. How are you?@0003@0009Well, thank you. And you?@0003@000C@0017Yes, I'm fine.@0003
But it's only because you've
been beside me as I've fought.@0003
You were always the one to
heal my broken body.@0003@0017@0009@0017You have that wrong, General. You're
the one constantly rescuing me.@0003
When I'm surrounded by enemies, when
I'm separated from the others@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CSister Natasha@0016... @0016Do you plan on
returning to Grado someday?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Yes. I must return to the temple.
Our people need my services.@0003@000CIs that@0016...@0016what you really want?@0003@0009@0016...@0016General Seth@0016...@0016@0003@000CCould anything sway you to
stay in Renais instead?@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0005
General Seth, what are you@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
I'm sorry. I'm@0016--@0016@0003
I'll be more direct.
Sister Natasha@0016...@0016@0003
When this war is over would
you@0016...@0016come live with me?@0003@0009Oh!@0003
But, Seth@0016... @0016I'm a cleric.
I'm sworn never to@0016...@0016@0003@000CI know you're a cleric. You've given
your life over to a divine calling.@0003
But would the Everlasting not smile
upon the love shared by its creations?@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016Seth, I@0016--@0016
Yes, I believe so.@0003@000CI vow upon the sacred oaths you have
sworn that I will make you happy.@0003@0009Seth@0016... @0016I hope you
keep that promise.@0003
I'll wait for you until this
war is finally at an end.@0003@000CI will keep my promise, Natasha.@0003
I will.@0003
# 0x0C83
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0113@000CYou're pretty good with a spear.@0003@0009@0017Thank you.@0003
I don't think I've introduced myself.
I'm the leader of the Knights of Renais@0016--@0016@0003@0017@000CI know you. Of course I know you.
You're General Seth, the Silver Knight.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Yes, that's right.@0003
And you are Cormag, the renowned
wyvern rider of Grado.@0003@0017@000CIf the legendary Silver Knight knows
my name, I can't be doing too bad, huh?@0003@0009You and your brother, Glen, are famous
even among the Knights of Renais.@0003
We have no wyvern riders in Renais, and
your stories are favorites among the men.@0003
I've been watching your combat style
since you joined our forces.@0003@000COh, is that so? Well, tell
me: what do you think?@0003@0009I'd love a chance to spar with you.@0003@000CNot a chance. I could
never beat you.@0003@0009So you say, but I can see in your eyes
that you'll never accept failure.@0003@000CHeh@0016...@0016@0005@0003
And all this time, I thought you
were just another loyal dullard.@0003
Guess I was wrong. We should
chat some more sometime.@0003@0009Yes, I think I'd like that.@0003
Perhaps once things have eased up.
I'm looking forward to it, Cormag.@0003@000CSure thing.@0003
# 0x0C84
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0104@0009@0017Hey, Seth.@0003@0017@000C@0017Ah, Cormag. Good timing.@0003
I had something I wanted to ask you.
Your family, are they all soldiers?@0003@0017@0009Why do you ask?@0003@000C@0017Your skill with the spear is amazing.
Have you trained since you were a child?@0003@0017@0017@0009No, I come from a long line of dirt-poor
farmers. I wielded a plough, not a spear.@0003
When we were kids, Glen and I had to
chase birds and animals from our fields.@0003
We used sticks and stones, and I think
that helped with our aim, to be honest.@0003@000CIs that so@0016...@0016
So why did you join the army?@0003@0009It's a funny story, really.@0003
@0016...@0016The emperor's caravan passed through
our village one day.@0003
My brother and I watched the glorious
procession from the top of a tree.@0003
@0017Then, a stray dog started to harry the
horses pulling the emperor's carriage.@0003
We threw rocks to drive off the mutt,
but some soldiers decided to arrest us.@0003@0017@000CWhy? You were trying to help@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yes, well. We didn't just hit the dog.
We got a few of the soldiers as well.@0003@000CAh-ha@0016...@0016
So, what happened next?@0003@0009Well, the emperor shows up in the room
the soldiers had thrown us.@0003
He looks around and, in this very calm
but stern voice, says to the soldiers:@0003
"What are you men doing, arresting mere
children? They were trying to help!"@0003
Then, he invites us to dine at his table,
and it was a luxurious feast, I tell you!@0003
Now, we were just kids. We lacked the
basic courtesies. We were just filthy.@0003
And we kept droning on about the most
idiotic things: chores, the village@0016...@0016@0003
But he listened to us intently, and
that fatherly smile never left his face.@0003
And he said, You lads are good at
driving off dogs with stones@0016...@0016@0003
Your skills are wasted in the fields. Let's
see how you fare with spears instead.@0003@000CAnd that's how you were recruited.@0003@0009Exactly. It's difficult to ignore
such a commanding presence.@0003
But@0016...@0016the emperor changed. I still
can't believe what's happened.@0003@000C@0016...@0016I was born into a family of knights, so
it was a given that I should be one, too.@0003
I trained in spear and sword. I studied
chivalry and swore my oaths of fealty.@0003
And because of my hard work, the late
King Fado treated me like a second son.@0003
@0016...@0016It's funny. You and I are from different
worlds, but we share the same loyalties.@0003@0009True@0016...@0016@0003
But King Fado is dead now.@0003
And my emperor is the one
who killed him@0016...@0016@0003
My emperor is as good
as dead to me.@0003@000C@0016...@0016I already serve a new lord.@0003
Cormag, you will find a ruler
worthy of your loyalties, too.@0003@0009Yeah, I hope so@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0C85
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0113@0009Can I have a word with you, Cormag?@0003@000C@0017Oh, Seth. Of course.
What can I do for you?@0003@0017@0009I've been thinking about your story,
and I've come to a decision.@0003@000CHm? What are you talking about?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Cormag, listen.@0003
As general of the Knights of Renais,
I'd like to offer you a post.@0003@000CWhat? You want me to join
the Knights of Renais?@0003@0009Yes, exactly.@0003
I've been watching you fight, and I've
been thinking about this for some time.@0003
Since we've been speaking, I've seen
more than just your fighting prowess.@0003
I've seen that you're a strong and
noble person as well.@0003
You are a man I would risk my life
fighting beside.@0003
Prince Ephraim will be a great king.
Would you fight for him with me?@0003@000C@0017I really appreciate it.
Thanks, Seth.@0003
@0017But@0016...@0016Grado is my home. I can't trade
loyalties to Renais just like that.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016I knew you would say that.@0003@0017@000CEmperor Vigarde is my only lord.@0003
My duty now is to correct the
mistakes he has made.@0003
That's why I'm here. I hope
you can understand.@0003@0009@0017Yes, of course@0016...@0016
Still, I'm glad that I met you.@0003@0017@0017@000CSame here, Seth. Now, let's get
this war over with, shall we?@0003@0009Yes, and when it's done, we'll get
together and tell some stories.@0003@000CI'm looking forward to it!@0003
# 0x0C86
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0106@000CSay, Sir Gilliam, can
I ask you a question?@0003@0009What is it, Franz?@0003@000CAre you disturbed about 
fighting with me?@0003@0009Why would you say something like that?@0003@000CYou and I are from different lands.
We have different backgrounds@0016...@0016@0003
I thought that might've made
you feel uncomfortable.@0003@0009Blast. I don't need to answer that.@0003@000C@0080@000D@000BSir Gilliam!@0003@0009Listen: I'm here by my king's order, and
by his order alone.@0003
I'm well aware that we have diverse
backgrounds and experiences.@0003
I don't care who I pair up with. You can't
always have your own way.@0003
That's just how it works in Frelia. It's
luck of the draw, you follow?@0003
Do they let you swap partners until you
find that special someone back in Renais?@0003@000B@0080@000E@000COh, no! No, no, no@0016... @0016That's
not what I meant.@0003
It's just@0016... @0016I was worried that I might be
slowing you down with my lesser skills.@0003@0009Franz, you're wasting your time worrying
when there are better things to be done.@0003@000CLike what?@0003@0009Like training, of course.@0003
Quit your worrying and show me how
good a Knight of Renais can be.@0003@000C@0017I could ask for nothing
better. Please!@0003@0017
# 0x0C87
@0017@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105@000CFranz, I can see your
training has paid off.@0003@0009Yes, and I have to say, I'm surprised.
I feel the energy flowing through me.@0003
I think it's because of my resistance
training, actually.@0003@000C@0017Frelia's resistance training, you mean.@0003
You mean to tell me that you have
no training like that in Renais?@0003@0017@0009We do have a system to strengthen our 
chest, arms, shoulders, and legs.@0003
However, that's where we stop. We don't
train each individual finger@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Every muscle acts in relation to each other
muscle. How can you neglect the fingers?@0003
That's how we Frelians think.@0003@0017@0009Fascinating how our countries can have
such distinct training systems, isn't it?@0003@000C@0017And you've been training with our system
every day without a single complaint!@0003
I'm impressed.@0003@0017@0009Oh, that's because, each night before
I go to sleep@0016...@0016@0003
I do our traditional relaxation exercises.@0003@000C@0017Relaxation exercises?@0003@0017@0009Before going to bed, flex each muscle you
used, and you'll wake up feeling refreshed.@0003@000C@0017What, no fatigue the following day?@0003@0017@0009That's right. That's what it's for.@0003@000CThat's wonderful!@0003@0009I can teach you if you like.@0003@000CPlease.@0003@0009Fantastic! We'll start tonight!@0003
# 0x0C88
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0106@0009Well, Franz, it looks like there's
a lot I can learn from Renais.@0003@000CWhy the change of heart, Sir Gilliam?@0003@0017@0009I've been doing your exercises every
night, and I feel fantastic.@0003@000CI'm glad you like it.@0003@0009I appreciate Renais much
more, thanks to you.@0003@000CReally?@0004
I'm glad.@0003
I'm thrilled that the great Sir Gilliam
approves of the training in Renais.@0003@0009@0017Thrilled? You're overreacting.@0003@0017@000CNo, honestly! I am thrilled. It's
a small thing, I know@0016...@0016@0003
But when someone recognizes the fine
qualities of Renais, I get a thrill.@0003
Renais is a small country, but it
contains much that is good.@0003@0009I don't know Renais, but I do know
how you feel as a fellow knight.@0003
The more we are away, the more we
think back on our beloved homeland.@0003@000CI'm glad that I'm not alone in this.@0003@0009Chin up, lad. Be proud of your country,
Franz, Knight of Renais.@0003
As your friend from neighboring Frelia,
I'm glad you're proud of your home.@0003@000CYes, Sir Gilliam!
Thank you very much!@0003

Everything is fine.@0003
And you look like you're doing
well, too. I'm relieved.@0003@0009Yes, but it's all thanks to everyone's
care and concern, really.@0003
I'm grateful for all the attention
everyone has paid to my safety.@0003
That goes for you, too, Franz.@0003@000COh, pshaw, Sister Natasha. I am just
a pawn, really. I don't do much@0016...@0016@0003@0009You are too modest, Franz.
I'm telling you the truth.@0003@000CThank you.@0003@0009By the way, that's a very
interesting satchel you have.@0003@000CHuh?@0003@0009It's not military issue, is it?@0003
I haven't seen any of the other
cavaliers carrying one like it.@0003@000COh, this old thing? To tell you
the truth, I made it myself.@0003@0009Really?@0003@000CYes. This pouch holds a skin of water,
and this pocket is for food.@0003
There's also a pocket for herbs@0016...@0016
I can find everything very quickly.@0003
Oh, and I've also fixed it so that it
won't shake about while I'm riding.@0003
It's easy to carry on one shoulder or sling
over both. And it goes with everything.@0003@0009That's nice!
You're so handy.@0003@000CThank you.
It's@0016...@0016probably my only redeeming trait.@0003
Uh@0016... @0016Would you like one?
I can make one for you.@0003@0009Really?
That would be wonderful.@0003
But@0016...@0016are you sure?@0003@000CYes, of course.

I'm still such an amateur@0016...@0016@0003@0009You're serious and focused, Franz.@0003
You grow stronger every day, and
you're sure to be a wonderful knight!@0003@000CThank you@0016...@0016@0003
But I've never excelled in either the
spear or sword, and I'm a small man.@0003
I'm not much when compared to the
likes of our other men.@0003@0009There are many types of knights.@0003
Some are strong, some are swift,
and others are intelligent.@0003
You possess a wonderful talent
that no other man can match.@0003@000C@0017Me@0016...?@0016@0003@0017@0009Yes. You have a pure heart.@0003
It is stronger than any spear, and
it possesses its own brand of power.@0003
You should have more confidence.@0003@000C@0017Sister Natasha@0016...@0016@0003
@0016......@0016@0005
A@0016...@0016pure heart@0016...@0016@0003@0002
@0017Thank you very much.@0003
I'll take your words to heart
and try to be more confident.@0003@0009That's good.@0003@000COh, by the way.
Here you go@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Hm?
Oh, that's@0016--@0016@0003@0017@000CYes, it's my mother's comb.@0003
I would like it if you
chose to keep it with you.@0003@0009@0017Franz@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CI've let myself believe that it
protected me from harm.@0003
Now, I would like to believe that
it protects you, too@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016@0003
Franz, I can't. This is
something you should keep.@0003@0017@0017@000CSister Natasha?@0003@0009You took this comb because you believed
your mother was protecting you.@0003
This comb embodies all your memories
of and feelings for your mother.@0003
It should remain in your hands.
That's where it belongs.@0003@000CSister Natasha@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017But I do thank you@0016... @0016It is
a remarkably tender gesture.@0003
I'm very happy.@0005
@0016...@0016@0003
Franz@0016... @0016The only reason I fight on with
confidence is because you are with me.@0003@0017@0017@000CWell@0016...@0016that's just not true.@0003@0009No, I'm serious.@0003
You see, for me, you are the
person who makes me feel@0016...@0016@0003
Well, strong. Strong and confident.@0003
Your presence is better than a
good-luck charm or anything else.@0003
I hope that you and I spend more time
together, fighting for this just cause.@0003@000CYes!@0003
Thank you for all your kind words.
I certainly hope so, too.@0003@0009Together, let's restore peace to all
countries, not just Renais and Grado.@0003@000CYes, Sister Natasha.@0003
It is a noble cause, and we
will bring victory!@0003@0009Then let's fight. For victory
and for friendship.@0003@000CYes, my lady!@0003
# 0x0C8C
@0017@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0106@000CBrother.@0003@0009Hey, Franz.@0003@000C@0017I'm glad to see you're still
in one piece!@0003
@0017After that last battle, I was
starting to get a little worried.@0003@0009I'm glad you're all right, too.
Good job out there, by the way.@0003
Your fighting form is perfect.@0003@000CThanks, Forde.@0003
@0017I keep thinking about this war@0016...@0016
What do you think will happen?@0003@0017@0009Dunno. I mean, whatever
happens happens, right?@0003@000C@0017Always quick with a joke@0016...@0016@0003
But I'm serious this time.
What do you think?@0003@0017@0009Hey, I was being serious.@0003
We are the best and brightest of our
age, but we face overwhelming numbers.@0003
If you ask me, all I can say is that
I hope we win.@0003@000C@0017It takes more than just hoping for it.@0003
We need to FIGHT for it. We are Knights
of Renais, and it's our duty to fight.@0003@0017@0017@0009Sigh@0016... @0016You're so serious.
You're just like Kyle.@0003
If you take the battle too seriously,
you're sure to make a mistake.@0003@000CYou think so@0016...?@0016@0003@0009@0017Of course!@0003
It's good to be responsible, but you
have more pressing concerns at times.@0003@0017@0017@000C@0017All right, Brother. I know
what you're saying.@0003@0017
# 0x0C8D
@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0106@000CBrother@0016...@0016
Are you painting again?@0003@0017@0009Hm? Yes, well@0016...@0016it's a hobby.@0003
You fish, don't you?@0003@000CYes.@0003@0009What do you like about fishing?@0003@000CWell@0016...@0016it's different than hunting
for other animals. More patient.@0003
And yet, when I hold a fishing pole,
I feel my spear arm is getting stronger.@0003@0009When you're off duty, you should stop
thinking about spears and swords.@0003@000C@0016...@0016There's more@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yeah?@0003@000CI feel at peace.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Hm.@0003
Fishing sounds nice. Lets you relax,
purge your heart of the battlefield.@0003@000CYes, exactly.@0003@0009And that is important, isn't it?@0003
In battle or in daily life, you
just have to stop and rest, right?@0003
Hey, you should take a break sometime
and go fishing around here!@0003@000C@0017Ha! In the middle of a war?
You can't be serious.@0003
How could I possibly do that?@0003@0017@0009Hey, I'm not saying you should go
right in the middle of a battle.@0003
Do it when you're off duty. Maybe you
can help replenish our food supplies.@0003@000C@0017Really?@0003@0017@0009Sure, yeah.@0003
You go catch us a big fish,
and I'll eat it. It's a deal!@0003@000C@0017Huh?
Oh@0016...@0016right.@0003@0017@0009Now, I've something to look forward to.@0003@000C@0017Hm@0016... @0016Was this all just about
you getting some fresh fish to eat?@0003@0017
# 0x0C8E
@0017@0009@0010@0116@000C@0010@0106@000CBrother.@0003@0009Franz, that was the best
fish I ever tasted. Thanks.@0003@000CI was feeling guilty a little
while I was fishing though.@0003
I was off duty, but still@0016...@0016we are
in the middle of war.@0003
I guess it's fine. General Seth seemed
to like it well enough, too.@0003@0009Yup. And as long as everyone's
happy, there's no harm done.@0003@000C@0016...@0016
Brother. I've realized something.@0003@0009Huh? What's that?@0003@000CYou are my role model.@0003@0009@0017Franz, what's with you?
All of a sudden, you@0016--@0016@0003@0017@000CNo, it's not sudden at all.@0003
Come to think of it, I became a
soldier so I could be like you.@0003
And now, I'm going to work harder,
so I can be a great knight like you.@0003@0009That@0016...@0016@0003
That doesn't make any sense. Have you
seen how lazy I am? Seriously.@0003
There are MUCH better role models out
there for you to hero-worship.@0003@0017@000CNo, no. You like to act lazy. It's
part of your charm, isn't it?@0003
But once the battle starts, everyone
sees how sharp a warrior you are.@0003@0009Is that so?@0003@000CYes, it is. And I also know that you
like to play the part of the fool@0003
for no other reason than to give these
weary soldiers a reason to smile.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003@000CAnd your sword and spear skills surpass
those of any knight in the service of@0003
Renais, Frelia, or any other kingdom.@0003@0009@0017Wow. Your flattery is far more
than I deserve@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CThe only reason you paint is to acquire
a better understanding of geography,@0003
so that you can use that knowledge
in battle@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Nah@0016...@0016
It's just a hobby.@0003
Don't give me too much credit.@0003@0017@000CI'm not.@0003
Think about it. You only paint
landscapes, isn't that true?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@0016...@0016The last portrait I ever painted
was of Mother@0016...@0016@0003@000CMother?@0003@0009@0017Never mind. Not important.
Anyway, I'm shocked. SHOCKED.@0003
Yeah, if you need a role model,
look to General Seth.@0003@0017@000COf course I admire General Seth.@0003
But that's just admiration.
@0017You're still my role model.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0003
Well, I can't tell you what to think.
I just hope you don't regret this later.@0003@0017@000CDon't worry. I won't.@0003@0009Hm. Whatever you say.@0003@000CYes.
So, that's that.@0003
Now, make sure you don't get
yourself killed in a fight.@0003
Bye.@0003@000C@0011@0007@0009Franz@0016...@0016@0003@0002
I need you to survive this war.
You and I will go home together.@0003
When this war is over, you and I
will go home and rebuild our lives.@0003
# 0x0C8F
@0017@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0106@000C@0017Oh, hello there. You're@0016...@0016@0005
@0017Ah, it's Amelia, isn't it?@0003@0009@0017Hm? Oh@0016...@0016
@0017Yes, and you're Franz!@0003@000CThat's right. How are you?
Getting the hang of things?@0003@0009Oh, yes. Quite!@0003
You know, everyone here is so much
friendlier than the folks in Grado.@0003
I'm glad there are so many people
around my age traveling with us.@0003@000CYeah. I think I'm about the same
age as you are, too.@0003
You know what that means? That means,
from now on, you're my rival.@0003@0009@0017What?@0003@0017@000CWhat do you say?@0003@0009@0017Um@0016...@0016
Well, does that mean@0016...@0016@0003
I have to fight you?@0003@0017@000CNo, no. It's nothing as complicated as
all that. We'll just work together.@0003
See, I'll try to be better than you,
and you try to be better than me!@0003
Every day, try to be a better person
than you are today.@0003
It's easier to do when you've got
someone to work with.@0003@0009I see@0016...@0016
But why?@0003@000CYes, well.
Um@0016...@0016@0003
My brother's a knight, too, and he's
had someone like that for a long time.@0003
I've always been envious of the
competitive relationship he has.@0003
They compete, and they argue, and
they bicker@0016...@0016@0003
But I know they respect one another,
and they grow together.@0003
I envy that.@0003@0009@0017Um@0016...@0016@0005
I'm not sure I can be like that.@0003@0017@000CHa ha ha@0016...@0016
Don't worry about it.@0003
It doesn't matter who you are.@0003
All that really matters is that we
have someone like that in our lives.@0003
Besides, you are a qualified soldier,
are you not?@0003@0009@0017Er@0016... @0016I'm not honestly sure I'm
even qualified to be out here.@0003@0017@000CSame here.
That's why I picked you.@0003
Let's work together.@0003@0009All right!@0003
I'm not sure I can live up
to your expectations@0016...@0016@0003
But I'll do my best.@0003@000CGood. It's nice to
meet you, Amelia.@0003@0009@0017It certainly is!@0003@0017
# 0x0C90
@0017@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0119@000COh, Sir Franz!@0003@0009Amelia, hello.
Call me Franz.@0003@000C@0017What? But@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009We are rivals, right? There's no
need for the formality of titles.@0003@000COh, of course not, sir!@0003@0009Ha ha ha@0016...@0016
You did it again.@0003@000CWell, then@0016...@0016@0005
I got it, Franz.@0003@0009Good.@0003@000CHa ha@0016... @0016I'm not used
to being so casual.@0003@0009@0017Can I ask you, what do
you think of this war?@0003@0017@0017@000CWhat?@0003@0009I still don't understand why Grado
chose to invade Renais.@0003
Grado and Renais were allies. Their royal
families were close friends.@0003
Why, Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika
are friends with your Prince Lyon.@0003
I detect something funny here.@0003
I simply cannot believe a friendship
so strong could end so abruptly.@0003
How many lives have been destroyed by
such a seemingly random turn of events?@0003
Perhaps the prince and princess know
more of the truth, but@0016...@0016@0003@000CI@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to
besmirch your homeland's name.@0003@000CNo, it's all right. I wonder what
drives Grado's ambitions now, too.@0003
I was born in a rural village and
raised in Grado's countryside.@0003
Ever since I was a little child,
I took pride in my home's origins.@0003
Grado, of course, is named after the
legendary hero who saved all of Magvel.@0003
I thought I lived in a country that
believed in justice and peace.@0003
But this war@0016... @0016It's something
different than all that.@0003@0009Amelia@0016...@0016@0003
I'm sorry.@0003
This war must be especially
painful for you@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017I'll be fine, Franz.
But thank you, though.@0003
@0017It was wrong of Grado to invade
Renais. Nothing can justify it.@0003
Grado has no right to destroy whole
nations, ruin people's lives.@0003
This is all so@0016...@0016so wrong!@0003
I began this war as a soldier
in Grado's armies.@0003
But now@0016...@0016
I just want to believe@0016...@0016@0003
I want to believe in justice! I want
to know I'm doing the right thing!@0003@0009Amelia@0016...@0016@0003
I understand it all very well. Your
love of your homeland@0016...@0016@0003
Your sense of justice, of honor@0016...@0016@0003
If there's anything I can do to
help you, please let me know.@0003
@0017We are rivals, but that doesn't mean
we can't also be friends, right?@0003@0017@000CFranz@0016...@0016@0005
@0017Thank you.@0003@0017@0017@0009I won't let you down.@0003@000CNo, neither will I!@0003

Can I ask you something?@0003@0009What is it?@0003@000CWhy did you become a soldier?@0003@0017@0009Hm?@0005
@0016......@0016@0003

village and took my mother.@0003@000COh!@0003@0009I had no father@0016...@0016

But I don't remember my mother.@0003
But I swore that I would live my
every moment to its fullest.@0003
I swore to my parents that I would live 
a long life for them and be happy.@0003

embracing each passing moment.@0003
You believe in yourself, and your
faith burns in you, making you shine.@0003
I don't know what it is you plan
to do with your life,@0003

would you let me walk beside you?@0003
I have my own path to follow, I know,

@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@010E@000C@0017Sir Gilliam.@0003@0017@0009Well, if it isn't Garcia@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Your armor suits you. Must have taken
a lot of training to fight in it, eh?@0003
And it probably takes a lot of
strength to wear, too.@0003@0017@0009I don't want to brag, but@0016...@0016@0003
None of Frelia's knights can
match me for strength.@0003@000C@0017Oh, is that so? You know, in my day,
they said I was without equal.@0003
Hm@0016... @0016What do you say, Garcia?
Let's arm-wrestle!@0003@0017@0009You mean@0016...@0016right now?@0003@000C@0017Oh, why not! It won't
take more than a minute.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016
Very well. I accept your challenge.@0003@000C@0017Excellent! I'd expect no less
from a true knight! Let's go.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000D@0009All right@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000C@000BHah!@0003@000ANg!@0003@000B@0011@000A@0011@0007@0006@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@010E@0009@0016...@0016You beat me. Well, I've got
to hand it to you, Garcia.@0003@000C@0017Ha ha! Don't feel bad. You
almost had me for a minute there.@0003
I'm impressed!@0003@0017

@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@010E@000CSir Gilliam.@0003@0009Yes, Garcia?@0003@000CAbout that match the other day@0016...@0016@0003@0009What, you mean when we arm-wrestled?
@0017That was a GREAT match.@0003@0017@000CYes, well@0016... @0016I've been thinking.@0003
Now, if I remember it correctly,
I was using my sword arm@0016...@0016@0003
But you're left-handed, aren't you?
You were using your off hand.@0003@0009Huh?@0003
Oh, well@0016... @0016I didn't want
to say anything, but@0016...@0016@0003@000CI knew it!@0003
All right! We have to have a
rematch using our OTHER hands!@0003@0009Garcia, are you@0016--@0016@0003
Fine, fine. I accept
your challenge. @0003@000CLet's try this again!@0003@000C@0080@000D@0009Yes@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000C@000BHah!@0003@000AHmmmmm@0016...!@0016@0003@000B@0011@000A@0011@0007@0006@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@010E@000C@0017Hm@0016... @0016See, this
time, you beat me.@0003@0017@0009True, but it WAS your off hand
this time, and it was still close.@0003
Garcia, you really are amazing.@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha!@0003
You know, I feel good about this.
I lost, but@0016...@0016I feel good.@0003
With a great knight like you at
our side, we've nothing to fear.@0003@0017@0009@0017Don't be silly, Garcia.
You're an amazing fighter.@0003
With you in our midst, our
forces are invincible!@0003@0017@000C@0017Ha!@0003
Let us fight together, then, and
watch our enemies fall like leaves!@0003@0017@0009@0017Gladly!@0003@0017

Oh, Gilliam@0016...@0016@0003@000CSorry to bother you. You just seem
to have something on your mind.@0003@0009I do. I was@0016... @0016I was just thinking
about my son, Ross.@0003@000CAh, Ross. He's a good lad.@0003@0009It's@0016...@0016a wonderful feeling
to have a son, Gilliam.@0003
@0017I was so happy to learn I had a boy
who could follow in my footsteps.@0003@0002
@0017Do you have children?@0003@000COh, no@0016... @0016You know what the
life of a soldier is like.@0003@0017@0009Aye, I remember it well. But I still
found a wife. Don't you have anyone?@0003@000C@0017I@0016-- @0016Well, to be honest@0016...@0016@0003
There is someone I've had my eye on,
but what do soldiers know of love?@0003
I don't know how to win a woman's heart.@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha ha ha!@0003
Oh, don't take it too hard. These
are tough times for romance.@0003
As time passes, the world will change.
No, WE will change it.@0003
Wait for your time. When the world changes,
people change. Soldiers change. Just wait.@0003@000C@0016...@0016You're right.@0003
When this war ends, I'll be ready
to face a different type of battle.@0003@0009Yes.@0003
And when you do wed, you must be
sure to invite me and my boy.@0003
It will be a great celebration.@0003@000CYes, of course, my friend.@0003

@0016...@0016It's been a while.
You look great.@0003@000C@0017Likewise, Gilliam@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016
@0016...@0016Heh.@0003@0017@0009What is it, Syrene?
Is there something on my face?@0003@000C@0017Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.@0003
You're still one of the best-looking men
in Frelia's army.@0003@0017@0009You know I hate it when you tease me.@0003
What is that smile about?
You're making me very nervous.@0003@000C@0017You were with me on my first mission
as one of Frelia's pegasus knight elite.@0003
Do you remember?@0003@0017@0009Was I really? I hardly remember.@0003
I have a tough time picturing the
famous Syrene as a green recruit.@0003
That really was a long time ago.@0003@000COh, really? What do you
mean by that?@0003@0009Oh, nothing. Nothing.@0003
Just that you've always been
one of Frelia's finest warriors.@0003@000CGilliam@0016...@0016@0003
This mission matters more to me
than that first mission did.@0003@0009I understand. Much more hangs
in the balance if we fail.@0003@000C@0017We won't fail. I won't allow it!@0003@0017@0009Don't be a hero.@0003@000C@0017Thanks, Gilliam.@0003

Syrene?@0005
You look pale. Are you feeling unwell?@0003@0009I'm fine, Gilliam.
Don't worry about me.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016Syrene.@0003
People come to you when
they need advice, right?@0003@0009They do, yes. Why do you ask?@0003
Don't tell me you need
some advice from me.@0003@000CYeah. Can we talk?@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016well@0016...@0016
@0017Of course.@0003@0017@000CPeople come to talk to me, too. Must
be@0016...@0016the wisdom of age or something.@0003
But I don't know what to say. What do
you do if you have no advice to give?@0003@0009That happens all the time.
@0017But I've learned something@0016...@0016@0003
People feel better as soon as they let
it out. They just want you to listen.@0003
We're fighting a war. It's only natural
that people get scared and need comfort.@0003@0017@000CDo you@0016...@0016get scared?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Gilliam.@0003
Is this all just an attempt
to probe me for my problems?@0003@000COh, er, don't be@0016--@0016@0003@0009@0017Don't worry.@0003

hear a thing.@0003@0009Was it just in my head?
Hm. That can't be good.@0003@000CMoulder, you've been working yourself
too hard. You should rest.@0003@0009No, I'm not tired in the slightest.
I'm fine.@0003
I cannot believe you don't hear it!
Is something wrong with your ears?@0003@000CMoulder, please.@0003
I know I've seen many battles,
but I'm younger than you are.@0003
My hearing is fine.@0003@0009Then why can't you hear it? I'm
starting to worry about that noise.@0003@000CYour ears are playing tricks on you.@0003
# 0x0C99
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0105@0009There it was again! That sound I told
you about. Gilliam, did you hear it?@0003@000COh, not again. No, Moulder.
I don't hear anything.@0003@0009Is it really just me? Am I the
only one who can hear it?@0003@000CMaybe you should describe the
sound to me.@0003
Is it a dull noise? A chirp? If it's
louder, I should be able to hear it.@0003@0009No, it's nothing like that. It's
soft@0016...@0016a melody of some sort.@0003@000CA melody? Are you saying someone
is playing music during a battle?@0003
What kind of music? What sort
of instrument is it?@0003@0009I can't explain it.
It's so@0016...@0016heavenly.@0003@000CHeavenly?@0005 You don't suppose
it's some sort of@0016...@0016sign, do you?@0003@0009Gilliam, I would be happy if you
didn't say such things.@0003@000COh, sorry. But, Moulder@0016...@0016@0003
You're the one dedicated to spiritual
matters. I wouldn't be surprised if@0016--@0016@0003@0009I said enough of that, Gilliam. I must
be imagining things. That's all.@0003@000CA melody only you can hear.
Sounds mysterious to me.@0003@0009I agree. Especially because I can't
explain the cause. I must say, I'm worried.@0003
Gilliam@0016... @0016If something were to@0016...@0016
happen, well@0016... @0016I'm counting on you.@0003@000CMoulder, we've been friends for a decade
and a half. I'll protect you.@0003
Besides@0016...@0016it's my duty as
a Knight of Frelia.@0003@0009I know I can count on you, Gilliam.
I know that better than any man.@0003

# 0x0C9A

Can you still hear that melody?@0003@0009No, I haven't heard it for a while.
I guess it was a hallucination after all.@0003@000CRegardless of the cause, I'm glad
that you don't hear it anymore.@0003@0009I'm relieved, too, but@0016...@0016I also
miss it somewhat.@0003
The melody was haunting me, and
I finally remember what it was.@0003@000CAnd? What was the song?@0003@0009That was the music played 
at King Hayden's coronation. @0003@000CFrelia's coronation hymn.@0003@0002
@0017Ah, I remember it well@0016...@0016@0003
It is a strong song, and Frelia's
knightly choir performed it well.@0003@0017@0017@0009I was the one who carried
the crown to the throne.@0003
I was so nervous that I
might drop it!@0003@000CI remember that you were the one
to bear that regal burden.@0003
I was a mere recruit, stuck in
the back with the other whelps.@0003
You know, I remember now@0016... @0016Your
hands shook like you were frozen!@0003@0009Yes, and then someone shouted, in a loud
voice, Get ahold of yourself, man!@0003
The crown slipped, and I fumbled to
catch it! I was so embarrassed.@0003@000CI'm so sorry.
I was young.@0003
You know, I felt so bad that I have
spent years making it up to you.@0003
I acted before I thought. I'm sorry
for all the embarrassment I caused.@0003@0009That's right! I believe I met
you the very next day.@0003@0002
@0017Aha! I've figured it out!@0003@0017@0017@000CFigured what out?@0003@0009That melody@0016--@0016I could only hear it
when I was with you. That means@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009It was a sign. A sign from above that
we must both return to the basics.@0003@000CReturn to the basics? What does@0016--@0016
@0017Ah. Of course.@0003@0017@0017@0009Yes. We must remember who we were and
what drove us to join this cause.@0003@000CI believe you are right@0016...@0016@0003

go anywhere!@0003@0009Neimi, don't go off by yourself!

@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0105@000CNeimi. You seem to be adjusting
to the rigors of combat well.@0003
You're a skilled archer after all.@0003@0009@0017Oh@0016...@0016I'm so glad to hear you say that!
I was so sad after we talked last.@0003
I didn't know what to do, but then,
I decided to focus on my archery.@0003@0017@000CThat's the spirit, Neimi. So, have
you been training by yourself?@0003
I never mastered archery. I'm
sorry I can't help you train.@0003@0009@0017No, no@0016... @0016Thank you, but I've
been thinking about this a lot.@0003
First, I need to sharpen my vision
so I can target more easily.@0003@0017@000CSharpen your vision?@0003
Good eyesight seems essential
in a good archer, but@0016...@0016@0003
How can you improve your
vision? I don't understand.@0003@0009@0017My grandfather taught me to stare
into the distance and concentrate.@0003
My grandfather taught me everything
I know about the bow.@0003
My grandfather was@0016--@0016
He was a great archer.@0003
One time, a snake was attacking a bird 
nest on a tree in a mountain far away.@0003
He aimed at the snake and shot it down.@0003@0017@000CIncredible. He was able to pick out
and hit a snake from that distance?@0003
@0017Your grandfather must have been
a great archer.@0003@0017@0009@0017Yes, he was. And that's why I've
been staring into the distance.@0003
I've been training constantly on the
field, and my vision has improved.@0003
See that tree in the distance? I can
spot the bugs crawling on its leaves.@0003@0017@000CI'll be impressed when you can
hit each of those bugs from here.@0003@0009But@0016...@0016that would be cruel!@0003@000CThere's no need to shoot bugs. You
only need to shoot our enemies@0016...@0016@0003

skills your grandfather gave you.@0003@0017@0009@0017Don't you worry!

@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@010A@0009Neimi, I wanted to ask about your
vision-training regimen.@0003@000C@0017Ah, where I stare into the
distance and concentrate?@0003@0017@0009Yes. I've been trying it out
myself, but@0016...@0016@0003
I've had some problems.@0003@000CProblems?
What do you mean?@0003@0009Whenever I'm training, people
start to avoid me.@0003
It's not just that. Even animals
run away from me when I'm at it.@0003@000CAnd you're just@0016... @0016You're just
staring into the distance?@0003@0009Yes. Standing perfectly still,
staring into the distance.@0003@000CMaybe it's@0016...@0016because you look
scary@0016...@0016@0003
I used to get that a lot.@0003
Cormag said I was frightening him.
He thought I was angry at him.@0003@0009I look@0016...@0016scary? Hm@0016...@0016@0003
I have refined my stare to intimidate
my foes in battle. You may have a point.@0003
No wonder people get scared when they
see me glowering into the distance.@0003
You know, I might almost consider it
a compliment of my knightly prowess!@0003@000CI have an idea@0016... @0016Perhaps if you
@0017smile, it might not be so scary.@0003@0017@0009@0017@0016...@0016Like this?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009It's still scary, isn't it?@0003@000C@0017Uh@0016... @0016Maybe it's because you're
crossing your arms.@0003
How about@0016...@0016holding some flowers
instead? That might help.@0003@0017@0009You want me to stare into the distance@0016...@0016
smiling@0016...@0016and holding flowers?@0003@000C@0017I think that would look good@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009You're just being nice, Neimi.@0003
Your keen vision is a gift, and
your training may improve it@0016...@0016@0003
But I know I can never imitate it.
It's yours and yours alone.@0003
@0017I place much faith in your
sharp eyes and your steady hand.@0003@0017@000C@0017Th-thank you, Gilliam!
I won't let you down!@0003@0017

@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0108@0009Vanessa, how are you holding up?@0003@000C@0017Father Moulder.@0003
We are struggling, but
I'll pull through somehow.@0003
@0017Say, Father Moulder@0016...@0016@0003@0009You want to know about Prince
Innes, don't you? He's doing well.@0003
I was worried for a moment,
but he'll be fine.@0003@000COh!@0005@0003
I, uh@0016... @0016Thank you.
@0016...@0016@0003
How did you know?@0003@0009Well@0016...@0016@0003
You see, as a priest, I've met
people from all walks of life.@0003
Some of them@0016--@0016like you@0016--@0016well, I
can read them like an open book.@0003@000CYou@0016...@0016can read my mind?
That's so@0016...@0016embarrassing.@0003@0009No, no. It's not like that. I just mean
you are a pure, straightforward girl.@0003
That's a compliment worthy of a knight.@0003@000CDo you think so?
Thank you, Father.@0003@0009Hm. Say, would you like to hear
a story from the prince's youth?@0003@000CI'd like that, Father. Very much!@0003@0009@0017Hm@0016...@0016@0006
@0017Oh my!@0003
You know, I think we'd better
take care of our enemies, first.@0003@000CLook out!@0005
Over there!@0003
Stay here, Father. I'll
take care of this.@0003@0009Yes, I think that would be best.@0003@000CTell me your story another time,
though. I'd like to hear it.@0003@0009@0017I'd be delighted.
Another time, then.@0003@0017@000C@0017Yes, Father!@0003@0017
# 0x0C9F
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0108@0009Well, do you have time
for that story I promised?@0003@000CCertainly, Father.@0003@0009It was over ten years ago, when
the prince was just a child.@0003
There was a ceremony at the castle,
with a trick archer of sorts.@0003@000CA trick archer?@0003@0009Yes. He was a very famous and undeniably
skilled archer from abroad.@0003
He was to shoot a tiny target that had
been placed in the distance.@0003
However, in the middle of the show,
someone stopped him from shooting.@0003@000COh, no@0016... @0016It wasn't@0016--@0016@0003@0009Yes, it was young Prince Innes.@0003
He said, That's not far enough!
Move the target back farther!@0003
Then, he insisted on trying himself.@0003@000CThat's so like him!@0003@0009@0017Isn't it?
@0017King Hayden tried to stop him, but@0016...@0016@0003
Well, you know how he is.
He doesn't listen to anyone.@0003
And so, it became a contest between our
prince and this foreign archer.@0003@000CSo, what happened?@0003@0009First, they established the ground rules.@0003
Each person was to shoot at the target. If
both arrows hit, they increased the range.@0003
They simply continued to move the target
back until one person missed the mark.@0003@000CSounds simple enough.@0003@0009Ah, but the two were evenly matched.
Every shot was a perfect bull's-eye.@0003
The crowd cheered, and the target
moved ever farther back@0016...@0016@0003
But then it came to the turning point.
The foreign archer said, @0003
This is no test. Let's move the
target back more.@0003
It seemed like bravado, but the archer
actually had a clever tactic in mind.@0003@000CClever? How so?@0003@0009They had been shooting for some time,
and the archer's arms had grown weary.@0003
Precision archery is far more taxing
than the battlefield, you see.@0003
So even though he was a skilled archer,
he was at the limits of his endurance.@0003
He was still hitting the mark accurately,
but his arm was quivering more and more.@0003
Everyone knew that the prince was
on the verge of victory.@0003@000CI don't understand. They were shooting at
the same target, shot for shot, right?@0003
Why would moving the target make any
difference?@0003@0009Yes, they were still shooting at the
same target.@0003
However, the archer suggested that they
move the target much farther away@0016...@0016@0003
Much farther than any child Innes's age
could hope to loose an arrow to.@0003@000COh, that IS clever!@0003@0009Even the archer, with his trained arms,
was firing at his maximum range.@0003
In fact, he almost missed the target!@0003
Then, it was the prince's turn.@0003@000CAnd@0016...?@0016@0003@0009It was clearly too far away for the
young prince to hit the target.@0003
But His Highness was undeterred. He drew
his string and fired up into the sky.@0003
The arrow did not merely hit the target.
No, it was a perfect bull's-eye!@0003
You see, the prince arced his shot
to extend his range beyond its limits.@0003
To hit a target this way requires
incredible skill, but the prince did it.@0003
And then he turned to the archer and said,
Shall we move the target back farther?@0003
The archer looked so crestfallen. He
admitted defeat, and it was settled.@0003@000CThat's amazing@0016...@0016@0003@0009That it is.@0003@000C@0017Thank you very much, Father
Moulder! That's incredible!@0003
I'm even more@0016--@0016@0003@0017@0009More@0016...@0016what?@0003@000COh@0016...@0016
No, nothing.@0003@0009@0017I'm glad you liked the story.@0003
Keep up the good work, Vanessa.@0003@0017@000C@0017Yes, sir!@0003@0017

do your fellow pegasus knights proud.@0003
We are blessed to have you fighting
at our side.@0003@0017@0017@000CYou credit us warriors too much, Father.
Without healers, we would all be lost.@0003
Nothing I say can tell you how much
I value your presence here.@0003@0009We are all doing our
part in this war.@0003
No need to thank me.@0003@000C@0017I'm serious!@0003
Without your help, we would
never survive these skirmishes!@0003@0017@0009I'm gratified by that.

for the other day.@0003@0009Hmm?@0005
Oh, you mean that story?@0003@000CYes.@0003@0009@0017Ah@0016...@0016@0003

Good luck to you, Vanessa.@0003
I don't know where this will lead, but
I'm sure the prince knows your feelings.@0003@0017@000CFather Moulder, I only aspire to be
worthy of his greatness.@0003
I expect nothing in return.@0003@0009Are you sure?@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009Well, do what you think is best for you.@0003
We all carry many burdens@0016... @0016To country,
family, duty, honor@0016...@0016@0003

It's not my fault if I accidentally

They've been charred black!@0003@0017@0017@0009Oops@0016...@0016@0005
Those were your clothes?@0003
Tch! That IS a shame.
My mistake. I apologize.@0003@000CThis isn't the first time this has
happened, Colm!@0003

it in for my clothes!@0003@0009Oh, no, no. Don't be silly!@0003
And besides, only the bottom has been
singed. Just trim it off and wear it short.@0003
@0017See? Why, I'm sure you'll set the world

I asked of you?@0003@000C@0017Of course, Father Moulder!@0003
In fact, I've set aside a little time
each night to reflect on my day's deeds!@0003@0017@0009Good. I'm glad to hear you've taken
my suggestion to heart.@0003
Might I inquire as to what manner
of thing you're reflecting on?@0003@000C@0017Well, I reflected on how hungry I was, and
so I packed some extra salted pork today.@0003@0017@0009Did you say@0016...@0016salted pork?@0003@000C@0017Yes. See, on reflection, it had been
a while since I'd had salted pork.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0003
What about the day before?@0003@000C@0017Hm@0016...@0016 The day before@0016...@0016@0006
Oh, yeah!@0003
I was reflecting on how much walking we'd
done, and I realized I needed new shoes.@0003
I figured, next chance I get, I'd go
out and steal me a new pair!@0003@0017@0009Colm@0016...@0016@0003
I'm not sure you understand what
it is I asked you to reflect upon.@0003@000CYou told me to think about what I'd done
during the day and to reflect on it.@0003@0009I told you to think over the things 
you did and feel sorry for having done.@0003
I wasn't talking about what you wanted
to eat or whether you needed new shoes!@0003
That is not the point of all this!@0003@000C@0017Did it ever cross your mind that@0016...@0016@0003
maybe I haven't done anything I'm 
sorry about?@0003@0017@0009Don't be foolish!@0003
Think back on the things you've
done during the day.@0003
Then, think about the troubles you
caused and vow not to repeat them!@0003
Do you understand me now?
This is for your own sake!@0003
I'll come back in a few days.
Keep thinking!@0003@000C@0016...@0016I thought that whole self-reflection
thing was going a little too well.@0003

good, aren't I?@0003@0017@000CI'd say so. You're going over your
every action, from waking to sleep.@0003@0009Well, that's what 
you told me to do.@0003@0017@000CWell done, my lad!@0003
I've never heard so much thought
go into what you've done before!@0003
Compared with the salted pork,
your transformation is impressive!@0003
It's a little extreme, but@0016......@0016@0003@0009But the funny thing is@0016...@0016@0003
I've started noticing all these
things about me I didn't know before.@0003
I keep saying, That was wrong and
I'll do better next time.@0003
So@0016...@0016I'm not repeating the
same mistakes over and over.@0003@000CI had noticed that your behavior
has significantly improved of late.@0003
You look sleepy now, but your face
seems far more peaceful as well.@0003
It seems that you're finally growing
up, thanks to these quiet moments.@0003@0009Heh@0016... @0016You know, I think that's the
first nice thing you've said to me!@0003@000CYou're coming along just fine. But@0016...@0016
go easy on yourself, all right?@0003@0009How come?@0003@000CIf you stay up all night thinking about
your day, you'll make yourself sick.@0003
You've already mastered the art of
learning from your own experiences.@0003
I don't want you falling into old
habits because of a little illness.@0003
I have high expectations of you,
my son.@0003@0009Thank you, Father Moulder. I'm
glad that you do.@0003

We've been asking so much
of you lately@0016...@0016@0003@0009Don't worry about me.@0003
I'm rather more worried 
about you, Syrene.@0003
You had only just been transferred
to this unit when we left Frelia.@0003
I'd imagine it must be odd not
having any familiar faces around.@0003@000C@0017I've already learned everyone's
name and field of specialization.@0003
Don't worry about me.@0003@0017@0009Impressive. You've been
paying attention.@0003@000C@0017To beat your enemy, know your allies.@0003
Without knowing the skills of your
own men, you can never win a war.@0003
I don't want to die just because I didn't
know what to expect from my troops.@0003@0017@0017@0009I was worried about how well you
were integrating into our group.@0003
You seem to have matters well in hand,
though. I'm proud of you, Syrene.@0003
If you have any questions, 
don't hesitate to ask me anytime.@0003@000CThank you, Father Moulder. I do
appreciate your thoughtfulness.@0003

@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0107@000CSyrene, you said you'd already learned
everything about our little band.@0003
Did anyone in Frelia go over the details
with you before you left?@0003@0009No, Father. Things were rather hectic in
Frelia before we left, as you know.@0003
@0017Everything I have learned, I've
learned on the job, so to speak.@0003
People@0016...@0016confide in me, and I
learn by observation.@0003@0017@000CInteresting. So, even though you're new,
they know they can confide in you?@0003@0009@0017Yes. The ladies seem most
comfortable speaking to me.@0003@0017@000CI understand. Even a man of the cloth
is still, at heart, a man.@0003
It must reassure them to know that there
is another woman to whom they can speak.@0003
@0017There are many women among us.@0003
If I cannot be father to them, please,
care for them as a mother.@0003@0017@0009With all respect, Father, I refuse to
minister to their needs as a mother would.@0003
I am still young and unworthy. I prefer
to speak to them as a sister.@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha@0016... @0016Yes, of course.
Please excuse me.@0003
Help them, then, as a sister would.@0003@0017@0009@0017Yes, Father! Now, may I have a
word with you? As their sister?@0003@0017@000CI beg your pardon? @0005Me?@0005 What?@0003
Has someone@0016...@0016complained about me?@0003@0009@0017Well, I'll let you know the
day after next new moon.@0003@0017@000CMust I wait until then?@0003
Is it so terrible that I needs
must prepare myself for the news?@0003@0009@0017Rest easy, Father! It's only
a suggestion, not criticism.@0003@0017@000CHm@0016... @0016What could it be?@0003
# 0x0CA6
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@012B@0009So@0016... @0016Last night was a new moon.
And that means today is the day.@0003
I've been going mad wondering,
Syrene. What is your suggestion?@0003@000CAh, right you are, Father. It is
indeed the promised day.@0003
Well, then. On behalf of everyone,
I have two words for you.@0003
Father Moulder?@0003@0009Y-yes@0016...?@0016@0003@000C@0017Happy Birthday!@0003@0017@0009What? Birthday?@0003
Oh@0016... @0016Oh, yes! Why, today is
my birthday, isn't it? But@0016--@0016@0003@000C@0017It is a fine tradition to celebrate
one's birthday, Father.@0003
In a war, uncertainty surrounds us
every moment of every day.@0003
Instead of worrying about tomorrow,
let us celebrate life today.@0003
That should encourage us all to
keep going, wouldn't you say?@0003@0017@0017@0009Yes, indeed. To share the joys of life
is very important.@0003
Thank you, Syrene. In this chaos, I
would have forgotten my own birthday.@0003@000CYou exhaust yourself caring for others,
but you pay no attention to yourself.@0003
We are all so grateful to you, Father.@0003
So many different people came up to me
to ask how we could show that gratitude.@0003
You are a man of great virtue, and
an inspiration to us all.@0003@0009I am touched@0016...@0016@0003
At my age, I thought all my happy
birthdays were well behind me.@0003
I'm a little embarrassed at that@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou must remember to take care of
yourself, Father. And thank you.@0003

@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0108@000CCaptain Syrene!@0003@0009@0017Vanessa! How are you?
I was worried about you!@0003@0017@000CI'm fine, ma'am. Thank you for your concern.
Glad to see you doing well too.@0003@0009Vanessa, you know you don't need to 
talk like that when we're alone.@0003@000CBut we ARE on duty.@0003@0009Let me put it this way, then.@0003
This is an order from your captain!@0003
When we're alone, you are to speak to me 
as if we are at home.@0003@000CYes, ma'am!@0003@0009Vanessa. Sigh.
Did you listen to a word I said?@0003@000CY-yes.@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha! Yes, that's it!@0003
Oh, by the way, I have something for you.@0003@000C@0017What is it?@0003@0017@0009Here you go.@0003
Father wanted me to give it to you.@0003@000C@0017But this is@0016...@0016
The war god Fale's amulet!@0003@0017@0009@0017Yes, this is a battle amulet.
I received one before I left home, too.@0003
You were summoned so suddenly that Father
didn't get a chance to give it to you.@0003
And Mother wanted to tell you,
Never be apart from this amulet.@0003@0017@000C@0017But@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009She also wanted you to relax and do 
your best.@0003
And to get a good night's sleep always.@0003@000C@0017Well, I do try.@0003@0017@0009Maybe others don't notice, 
but I know you too well, Vanessa.@0003
I know you don't get enough rest when
you feel overwhelmed with responsibility.@0003
But, to be at your best, you need to take 
care of yourself, OK?@0003@000CYes, ma'am@0016--@0016I mean, Sis.@0003@0009I'll be right by your side tonight,
so just relax.@0003
You need a good night's sleep.@0003@000CThanks, Sis. I sleep better when 
you're around.@0003

@0017I mean, Sis.@0003@0017@0009You look better, Vanessa.
Did you sleep well?@0003@000CYes. First time in a long time.
Thank you, Sis.@0003@0009@0017I've been meaning to ask you@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0017@000CYes?@0003@0009You don't seem to have much 
appetite lately.@0003@000CWell, I've just been@0016--@0016@0003@0009I told you, Vanessa, I know you too well.@0003
So, who's the lucky guy?@0003@000CWhat?! That's just crazy!
I don't know what you're talking about!@0003@0009You know I can tell when you're lying.
Plus, you not eating is a dead giveaway.@0003
I mean, when's the last time you said no
to a cookie? It's not a criticism.@0003
One of your most charming qualities is 
how you can outeat anyone.@0003
It's because of someone special, isn't it?@0003@000CWell, um@0016...@0016@0003@0009But, Vanessa, first and foremost,
you have to take care of yourself.@0003
I'll support you no matter what, but 
no one is worth losing your health over.@0003@000CThank you, I guess. I'll do my best@0016...@0016@0003
Sometimes I think that if I were more 
like you@0016--@0016you know, a great knight,@0003
an attractive woman, and just 
all-around perfect@0016--@0016@0003
I'd have a better chance with him.
@0016...@0016@0003
Hmmm. That didn't sound as pathetic 
in my head as it did out loud.@0003@0009Don't be silly, Vanessa.
You may not know it,@0003
but I'm sure that person likes you for
who you are.@0003@000CDo you really think so?@0003
I've always wanted to be like you.
You've always been my role model.@0003
But, I feel like whenever I finally
catch up to you, you're already gone.@0003
You've already moved on.@0003
I'll never catch up with you, 
no matter how hard I try.@0003@0009@0017I'm very proud of you, Vanessa.@0003
And as your older sister, I recognize 
your talent more than anyone else.@0003
You should be more confident.@0003@0017@0017@000CI feel better after opening up to you.@0003
It's hard not to compare myself with you,
but I have to get past that.@0003@0009That's the spirit. And remember, 
you have to take care of yourself.@0003@000CYes, I know.
As always, thanks, Syrene.@0003
# 0x0CA9
@0017@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@012B@0009Hi, Syrene.
Thanks for talking the other day.@0003@000CAre you feeling better now?@0003@0009Well@0016... @0016It's not that easy, but
I quit comparing myself with you.@0003@000CYou might not know this, but there's
something about you I've always envied.@0003@0009@0017About me?@0005
What do you mean?@0003@0017@000CYou have an inner fortitude that 
I will never be able to match.@0003@0009@0017Inner@0016...@0016fortitude?@0003@0017@000CDo you remember when Father collapsed?@0003
Mother and I were so panicked that 
we didn't know what to do.@0003
You were the youngest of us all,@0003
but you gathered nuts in your small hands
and went to the village to sell them.@0003
Then you came home with medicine for him.@0003@0009@0017Well, I don't know what to say.@0003@0017@000CWhen you face a difficult circumstance,
your true self emerges.@0003
You were very young, but had the presence
of mind and ingenuity to help Father.@0003
You comforted me and Mother, and you
rescued Father.@0003
I've always respected your strength,
and wished for some of it myself.@0003@0009But@0016...@0016you were the one who joined 
the Knights at such an early age,@0003
and it was you who supported our family.@0003@000CI emulated your strength. 
I wanted to support my family like you did.@0003
It's always been my goal. And I respect 
you more than anyone else.@0003
I wish you could be as confident in yourself
as I am of you.@0003
No matter what, you'll always be all right.@0003@0009@0017All right, then. I have to tell you!
The person I love is@0016--@0016@0003@0017@000C@0017Wait, Vanessa!
Wait until the war is over to tell me.@0003
When everything is over, bring him home.@0003
@0017I'll go home a little ahead of you, and 
wait for you two with Father and Mother.@0003
We'll make your favorite meal@0016... @0016
Is that enough to convince you?@0003@0009Yes.@0003
I'll do my best@0016... @0016
For this war and also for him.@0003@000CThat's my girl. Don't worry.
You'll be all right.@0003

@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0110@000CPegasus!@0003@0009You must be @0017Lute!@0003@0017@000CAnd who are you?@0003@0009@0017I'm Vanessa.
I'm captain of Frelia's pegasus knights.@0003
And this here is Titania. We're both 
pleased to meet you, Lute.@0003@0017@000CAh, the pegasus, the proud, winged horse.@0003
You know, they only attach to someone they
accept as their master.@0003
And did you know that pegasi fly by kicking
the air, not by flapping their wings.@0003
It's a common misconception, but wings
are mainly used for gliding.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Yes, as captain, I learned all
this long ago. @0003
Plus, if they flapped their wings constantly,
no one would be able to ride them.@0003@0017@000CIn some countries, the word pegasus 
means fountain or ocean.@0003
Different cultures have different stories
about the creation of the pegasus.@0003
In one legend, there was a monster who
could turn anyone into stone.@0003
When the monster died, its blood seeped into
the ground. There, a pegasus was born. @0003@0009Interesting@0016... @0016You are very knowledgeable.@0003@000CI know.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Well! Thank you for the lesson. 
I'm glad we're on the same team.@0003
It was nice meeting you.@0003@0017@000CYes, nice to meet you, Titania.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009I'm Vanessa!@0003

strong impression on you, Lute. @0003
@0016...@0016@0005 So, what can I do for you?@0003@000CIt's common knowledge that pegasi have
strong resistance to magic.@0003
I developed a new counterattack to that 
power, but it still needs refining.@0003
I guess what I'm saying is@0016...@0016@0005
Can I try it out on Titania?@0003@0009What?!@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009No! Of course not!@0003@000CI was joking.@0003@0009Sigh. You said it with such
a straight face@0016...@0016@0003
You definitely had me fooled.@0003@000CThank you! That's so sweet of you to say.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009It wasn't a compliment!@0003
Besides, you really don't seem like someone
who has much of a sense of humor.@0003@000CIs that right?@0003@0009Yes@0016... @0016And it seems like your magic 
is the real thing.@0003
When you defeated the enemy the other day,
I saw a sharp flash of magic from above.@0003@000CGee, I wonder why that happened@0016...@0016@0003@0009Because@0016...@0016you're good?@0003@000CWhy, yes! You are 100 percent
correct! For once.@0003@0009@0017My point is, we don't have enough mages 
in Frelia, so we're counting on you.@0003
When I was growing up, I always wanted
to be a pegasus knight like my sister.@0003
I was also interested in magic, but
I just didn't have the talent.@0003@0017@000CWell, you are a great pegasus knight, 
so it's worked out fine.@0003
Besides, I am also interested in 
becoming a pegasus knight.@0003@0009@0017Where are you in your training?@0003@0017@000CI'm at 98 levels out of 158 levels total.@0003@0009That's very impressive@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Anyway, let's just do our
best out there, shall we?@0003@0017@000COf course.@0003
# 0x0CAC
@0009@0010@0108@000C@0010@0110@0009@0017Lute, did you know this?@0003
The wings of a thousand pegasi are
an incredibly potent aphrodisiac.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000CI@0016...@0016I didn't know that@0016...@0016@0005
OK, now I really need Titania's help.@0003@000C@0080@000C@0009@0080@000B@0009@0080@000A@0008Wait! Wait! I was just kidding!
Hush, Titania! Hush! I was joking!@0003@000A@0080@000E@000CI see@0016... @0016I was, um, kidding, as well.
Heh heh?@0003@0008@0080@000B@0009@0017Hee hee! Consider it payback.@0003
@0017But, Lute, I never thought you would 
try to steal the wings right off her back!@0003
Guess the battlefield is a lonely place!
Ha ha ha ha!@0003
You know, I'm often told that I need to
loosen up and not be so serious.@0003
I'd always tried to be like my sister.@0003
She's very strong, as both a knight and 
a person. Maybe I've tried too hard.@0003
But it's so much easier to loosen up 
with people like you around. Thanks!@0003@000CI see.@0003@0009@0017When I'm with you, I can
relax and just be myself.@0003@0017@000COh, I'm so sorry to hear that.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009That was a compliment!
Jeez. You're a tough one@0016...@0016@0003
@0017When this war is over, would you like 
to come visit me in Frelia?@0003
You could ride a pegasus if you'd like.@0003@0017@000CThat would be an illuminating experience.@0003
But I have to start reading up on pegasi
behavior now, so I won't get thrown off.@0003
Do they like carrots?@0003@0009@0017Well, I don't know about that.
I'll let you do your research.@0003
I must go now. See you later, Lute.@0003@0017@000CYes, Vanessa.@0003

knights.@0003@000CI'm Vanessa.@0003@0009@0017Yeah, that's right. Vanessa.
I'm Forde. Nice to meet you.@0003
By the way, what do you mean by me
being awake?@0003@0017@000CJust the other day, I was flying by 
and saw you lying on the ground.@0003
I thought you were hurt, but when I got 
closer, I saw that you were just sleeping!@0003
I couldn't believe my eyes. I was so 
disgusted that I just left you there.@0003
But then I started to worry about enemies
spotting you, so I went back.@0003
By the time I got back to where you were, 
you were already gone.@0003@0009@0017I catch them off guard that way and 
then attack. That's my strategy.@0003@0017@000CI seriously doubt that.@0003@0009@0017Ha ha ha!
But anyway, thanks for your concern.@0003@0017@000CYou really don't stress or plan much, do you?
So different from our prince@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017The prince of Frelia? 
Ah, you mean Prince Innes.@0003
I think he's almost 100 percent stress.
But I'm sure he's quite the ladies' man.@0003
I bet you have a crush on him, too.@0003
@0017You're blushing, so I must have hit 
a nerve!@0003@000CI-I don't! I didn't say anything!@0003@0009A romance between a prince and his knight?
What scandal! What intrigue!@0003
@0017It's all right, though. 
You can love anyone you like.@0003
You must have lots of competition,
seeing how he is a prince.@0003
It's much easier to date someone you can
be yourself around.@0003
Someone like, say, me would be ideal for you.
What do you say?@0003@0017@000CUm@0016...@0016@0003
Let's go, Titania.
We've wasted enough time here.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0017You don't have to run away like that!@0005

@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0108@0009Vanessa, are you all right?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CPrince Innes!
Yes, I'm fine. I'm glad YOU are fine, sir.@0003@0009Good, Vanessa.@0003
Your contributions to this war and also to
Frelia as a whole have been very valuable.@0003@000CThank you for your kind words, sir.@0003
I was so worried when a messenger from 
Carcino told us you were in danger.@0003
I worried for your safety.@0003@0009Nothing is going to happen to me.@0003
It's still very strange to me that
you are grown up and worry about me now.@0003
When you first joined the knights, 
you were just a girl.@0003
You've really grown, Vanessa.@0003@000CWell, um@0016... @0016I'm still learning.@0003@0009You are a great knight now.
@0017I'm counting on you, Vanessa.@0003@0017@0017@000CYes. I'll protect you at any cost.@0003@0009Ha ha ha!
Vanessa, you don't need to protect me.@0003
It's the other way around. As the prince
of Frelia, I have the duty to protect you.@0003@000C@0017Oh, yes! I didn't mean to offend!@0003@0017@0009Pshaw! 
But remember, I am counting on you.@0003@000CThank you, Prince!@0003
# 0x0CB1
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0108@000C@0017Your skills are so polished now!
I bet you could shoot down a drop of rain!@0003@0017@0009You flatter me, Vanessa, but my skills 
aren't quite there yet.@0003
But I've noticed that you have improved 
quite a bit since this war started.@0003@000COh! Thank you, sir.@0003@0009@0017You make me confident in battle.@0003@0017@000CMe?!@0005
Oh@0016... @0016Er@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Yes, you! 
With such a skilled knight at my side,@0003
I feel secure and can be my best in battle.@0003@0017@000COh@0016...@0016@0003@0009Besides@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009@0017I can always sense you trying to 
protect me at any cost.@0003
Normally, I don't need any help, 
but you are the exception.@0003
I'm grateful for your help.@0003@0017@000CThank you very much!
It is my duty to protect you at any cost!@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha. Your duty, huh. 
That's fine, Vanessa.@0003
No need to worry about risking your life.
I'm pretty unstoppable with you beside me.@0003@000CYou'll have to use a spatula
to peel me off your side!@0003
# 0x0CB2
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0108@0009What's wrong? You're spacing out.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CI'm sorry, Prince Innes!@0003
Watching you shoot that arrow
reminded me of something.@0003@0009What's that?@0003@000CThe time you demonstrated your archery 
skills at the king's birthday ceremony.@0003
You shot three arrows simultaneously, and
hit three different targets@0016...@0016@0003
I was so impressed. I still remember that
moment like it was yesterday.@0003@0009Well, even though there were three targets,
they were only about an arm length apart.@0003
It wasn't like shooting three enemies in
battle.@0003
It's only an exhibition trick.@0003@000CEven so, you couldn't have done it without
strong accuracy and concentration.@0003
It made a very strong impression on me@0016...@0016
I've admired your skills ever since then.@0003@0009Vanessa@0016...@0016@0005
Was it my skills you were admiring@0016...@0016@0003
or was it me?@0003@000CWhat?!@0005
Um@0016...@0016@0003@0009Just kidding@0016... @0016Kind of.@0003
@0017But I'm impressed you remembered it.
I had forgotten until just now. @0003@0017@000CI have@0016...@0016always been watching you@0016...@0016
and always been admiring you@0016...@0016@0003
I hope that doesn't sound too creepy.@0003@0009I don't know what to say@0016...@0016@0005
I've always known you as a knight.@0003
A great knight, in fact. 
But when this war is over,@0003
I would like to get to know the other
side of you. The woman.@0003
@0017@0016...@0016Ahem. Yes. Let's go, Vanessa.
Don't ever leave my side from now on!@0003@0017@000CDon't worry, Prince Innes!@0005
@0017I would follow you anywhere!@0003@0017
# 0x0CB3
@0009@0010@0109@0009Hmm@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0010@010E@000C@0017Ross.@0003@0017@0009Oh! Hi, Dad.@0003@000CWhat are you thinking about?@0003@0009Nothing@0016...@0016@0003
Well, maybe just@0016...@0016
What was Mom like?@0003@000CYour mother@0016... @0016Well@0016...@0016
Where do I start?@0003
In many ways, she was very
similar to Princess Eirika.@0003@0009Princess Eirika?@0003@000C@0017Yes. She was gentle, but also very
strong. She could share others' pain.@0003@0017@0009I see.@0003@000CWhat's wrong? Do you miss her?@0003@0009I was just thinking@0016...@0016@0003
When was the last time we 
visited her grave?@0003
Not since we left the village
and started this journey@0016...@0016@0003
It's been so long. She must
be lonely@0016...@0016@0003@000CRoss@0016...@0016@0003@0009When the bandits attacked
the village, we had to leave.@0003
But Mom's grave is still there.@0003@000CYes.@0003@0009Dad@0016...@0016@0003@000CRoss.
Let's go home when the war is over.@0003
To the village where Risa rests.@0003@0009Dad@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017We can rebuild the village again,
just the two of us.@0003
After all, that's where we belong@0016...@0016
You, me, and@0016...@0016your mother.@0003@0017@0017@0009Yes!@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009All right. But I'll have to be a
lot stronger to help with that.@0003
@0009@0080@000C@000ASo we'd better start training, Dad!@0003@000CIf you insist. Show me
what you've got!@0003

Good. That's it for today.@0003@000E@0011@0009@0010@0109@0009Whew! Wow!@0003@000CWhew.@0003@0009@0017You're so strong, Dad.@0003@0017@0017@000CHa ha ha! You're finally getting the 
hang of it, boy!@0003
Your stroke is heavier, and your swing
has definitely improved.@0003@0009Yes.@0003
I've been practicing all the time,
even when I'm not in battle.@0003
Maybe someday, I'll even surpass you!@0003@000CYou're getting stronger, no doubt about it.
But I'm not going to LET you win.@0003
You'll have to get there yourself.@0003@0009Now you're talking! The higher the hurdle,
the bigger the reward.@0003
All right, I'm gonna go practice my
swing! See you later, Dad!@0003@000CAll right, boy.@0003
@0002@0009@0011@000CRisa, you'd be so happy. Ross has
grown into a strong young man.@0003

Ow@0016... @0016Ow! Ow! What are you doing?@0003
That hurts! You're crushing my shoulder!@0003@000BRoss@0016...@0016@0003@0009What's wrong, Dad?@0003@000BRoss@0016... @0016I'm going to be sentimental
for a moment. Bear with me.@0003@0009Huh?@0003@000BYou may be almost grown, but you're
all I've got in this world.@0003
It's true that your skills have
improved, but don't act foolishly.@0003@0009Huh?@0003@000BThere's no greater tragedy than when
a parent must bury his child.@0003
Do you see where I'm going with this?@0003@0007@0009Yes@0016...@0016I understand. It's just weird
to hear you talking like this@0016...@0016@0003
I guess I have been getting a big head. 
No one is invincible.@0003@000BYes, that's right.@0003
And when you start to think you are,
that's when you're the most vulnerable.@0003@0009I was just all puffed up when you said
I had improved. I'll be careful from now on.@0003
@0017I haven't told this to anyone,
but I guess dads can see these things.@0003@0017@0017@000B@0017No matter how old you get, you'll 
always be my son.@0003@0017@0009Yes, and I'll always look up to you!@0003
# 0x0CB6
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@010E@000CYou must be Dozla.@0003@0009That's right! Who are you?@0003@0017@000CMy name is Garcia. Sir Dozla, I've 
been hearing a lot about you lately. @0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Only good things, I hope! Ha ha ha!
I've heard of you, too, Sir Garcia.@0003
Mostly about your incredible strength!
Hey, would you mind lifting this boulder?@0003
Just kidding! Ha ha ha!@0003@000CHa ha. It's not a big deal.
Are you normally this@0016...@0016energetic?@0003@0009Well, I stuffed myself, so 
I'm feeling pretty great!@0003@000CYou can't fight on an empty stomach.@0003
Eating is very important to keep up 
your strength. Especially breakfast.@0003
I've heard that in some cultures, they call
breakfast first break.@0003@0009What's that? What do they break?@0003@000CA fast.@0003@0009@0017A fast what? Huh? Speak plainly! I don't
understand all this talking in circles.@0003@0017@000CWe don't eat anything while we sleep,
so it's as if we are fasting.@0003
So, the meal you eat in the morning
breaks that fast.@0003
This means that breakfast is an 
especially important meal.@0003@0009@0017Huh. Who would have thunk it?@0003
@0017The only thing I consumed this
morning was knowledge!@0003@000CWhat do you mean?@0003@0009Just that I make it a point
to learn other disciplines.@0003
You have to if you want to
grow as a fighter.@0003@000CI completely agree.@0003
Young men in this army are strong in 
their specific fields, but weak in others.@0003
The art of complete training has been
lost on the younger generation, I'm afraid.@0003@0009Yes, that's right! Back in our day,
fighters had to learn many disciplines@0003
in case they had to fill in for a 
wounded teammate.@0003
I've always wanted to learn archery.@0003
The delicate precision is the opposite of
fighting with an axe.@0003@000CMe, too. Why don't we meet sometime
and study it together?@0003@0009That's a great idea!@0003

a conversation, except with weapons!@0003@0009You DO know that you're not supposed to
swing the bow like an axe, right? Ha ha!@0003@000CI was only clowning around!@0003
I'm recalling that a certain someone
loaded the arrow in the wrong direction@0003
and nearly impaled his shoulder.
Hmmm. Now, who could that have been?@0003@0009That was a defect in the arrow!@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm sure!@0003@0017@0009@0017Maybe you just can't teach old
dogs new tricks.@0003@0017@000CI don't believe that's true at all.@0003
You're magnificent with an axe. How 
hard can it be to learn something new?@0003@0009No, you're the great one. 
You're a menace to the enemy!@0003@0017@000CWhere did you learn to fight like that?@0003@0009Well, I used to lead troops in Renais.
I learned the basics there@0016...@0016@0003
Once I retired, I was living on a mountain.@0003
My daily chores involved swinging an axe,
although just for splitting firewood.@0003@000CSee? You learned how to apply your skills
to different fields.@0003
Maybe archery just isn't our thing. We
should try something else.@0003@0009What do you suggest?@0003@000CHow about magic?@0003@0009Hmmm@0016...@0016@0003@000CIt can't be that difficult to learn.@0003
As far as I can tell, it's just a bunch
of arm waving and shouting gibberish.@0003@0017@0009You do have a point.@0003@000CLet's practice sometime soon.@0003@0009I'm looking forward to it@0016...@0016Mage!@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha! Yes, indeed!@0003@0017
# 0x0CB8
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@010E@000CThat did not go as well as I had hoped.@0003@0009Well, that's not entirely true, is it.@0003@000CIt would have helped if you hadn't
whacked me in the head with the staff.@0003@0009I didn't mean to hit you! You just got
in the way when I was@0016...@0016conjuring.@0003@000CI still have a lump on my head.@0003@0009I feel badly about it, all right?@0003
Besides, I think you're forgetting
that I also healed you with that staff!@0003@000CNo, you didn't! 
You burned my beard clear off!@0003@0009Oh, yes. That's right.@0005
I'm sorry.@0003@000CHmph.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0017@0009You have to admit, though, you looked
quite dashing without that beard.@0003
It took at least ten years off of your
appearance. No, at least twenty!@0003@000CYou really think so?@0005
I can't stop smelling burnt hair.@0003@0009But, wait! At least give me credit for 
making it grow back that quickly.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
Very well.@0003
It grew back nicely. Thank you.@0003@0009You're welcome!@0003@000CThis little foray into other disciplines 
has certainly taught me a lot.@0003@0009@0017Me, too!@0003

should be a piece of cake!@0003@0017

the gold falcon@0016...@0016@0003@0009Huh? Oh, this? My late grandfather gave
it to me.@0003
It was too big for me, so I resized it

a bow@0016...@0016@0003
This is a keepsake he gave me.@0003@000B@0080@000E@000CIs your grandfather's name Zethla?@0003@0009How in the world@0016...@0016?
Did you know him?@0003@000COf course. He was THE master archer.
He was known as Single-Arrow Zethla.@0003
He had amazing accuracy and could shoot
any target, moving or still, with one shot.@0003
No second arrow for Zethla was what 
people would say.@0003
Renais tried to recruit him many times@0016...@0016@0003@0009Now that I think about it,@0003
when Grandpa went hunting, he would take
only one arrow with him.@0003
@0017Me, I always took many arrows@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CSo, it WAS true!@0003@0009@0017He never did join the army, even though
recruiters did come by often.@0003
He said that it wasn't in his nature@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CI know. In fact, I visited him once when 
I was young.@0003
He was wearing the gauntlet that day,
and it left an impression.@0003@0009I see@0016...@0016@0003
Renais is such a big country, I never 
would have thought that you knew him.@0003

@0017I'm sure your wife understood how you felt.@0003@0017@0009I think it's hard to understand when
you are not a soldier.@0003@000CIn times like this, you have to fight to 
stay alive.@0003@0009You've lost family too, didn't you?@0003@000CYes.@0005
But, I can't keep crying.@0003
I have to be strong and keep going.@0003@0009Neimi@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou quit the army and lived in a 
mountain village with Ross because@0003
Renais was not at war, didn't you?@0016@0003@0016@0009Yes.@0003@000C@0017You don't seem to be the type of person 
who enjoys fighting for its own sake.@0003
I think you know the emptiness and pain of
war more than anyone else.@0003
I can see that just by looking at you!@0005
Em...@0003
I'm sorry if I'm being presumptuous.@0003@0017@0017@0009No, Neimi. Thank you.@0003
You are very perceptive. You'll make some
lucky guy very happy someday.@0003@000C@0017Oh@0016...@0016 Um@0016...@0016
This is kind of embarrassing.@0003@0017@0009Don't be embarrassed!
Oh, by the way, please take this.@0003@000C@0017What is it?@0005
@0017Oh, this haircomb is lovely!@0003@0009I bought this for my wife when
I was still in the Renais army.@0003
But@0016...@0016I never had the chance to
give it to her.@0003@000C@0017Sir Garcia@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009I buried her with some of the things
I'd brought back.@0003
I don't know why, but I couldn't
bring myself to bury this, though.@0003
I don't need it. What would I do with
it? You'd make better use of it.@0003
It will give you a reason to keep
using that mirror of yours, too.@0003@000CSir Garcia! This is too much! Thank you!
I will take good care of it!@0003

@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@0109@000CHey, you!@0003@0009I hope that maniac isn't talking to me.
I'll pretend I can't hear him. La la la.@0003@000CYou, over there! Mage woman!@0003@0009Are you talking to me? Firstly, my name
isn't Mage Woman, nor is it You.@0003
Why don't you lower your voice and
act a little more civilized? Who are you?@0003@000C@0017I'm son of the warrior Garcia, Ross.@0003@0017@0009So you're Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.
That's an unusual name. @0003
I'm Lute, genius mage extraordinaire. 
You've probably heard of me.@0003
So, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross, 
how may I be of service to you?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CMy name is ROSS! You're kind of weird.@0005
@0017Hey, you can use magic, right?@0003@0017@0009Yes, although to be more accurate,
I don't just use magic.@0003
I am a master of all magic. 
Please don't make that mistake again.@0003@000C@0017Wow, that's really great.@0003@0017@0009Well, maybe for you. For me, I'm
just that good. It's normal.@0003@000CIsn't it hard to remember all those spells?@0003@0009Well, I think for the average person,
it probably is a difficult task.@0003
But for me, it is as simple as using a
hint of fragrance when baking a cake.@0003@000CI@0016...@0016have no idea what you mean.@0005
@0017Wait a second!@0003
Does that mean even I could learn magic?@0003@0017@0009No.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CHey! At least pretend to ponder the
question for a little bit before you answer.@0003@0009OK. Bye.@0003@0009@0011@000CHey! 
@000C@0080@000E@000C@0080@000D@000BHey, wait a minute!@0003
# 0x0CBD
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@0110@0009Hey, mage lady! I mean@0016...@0016 Let's see@0016...@0016 Lute!@0003@000CHello, Sir Son-of-warrior-garcia-ross.@0003@0009It's ROSS!@0003
You left in the middle 
of the conversation!@0003@000CThank you, but it's no big deal.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009That wasn't a compliment!@0005@0003@0002
@0017So, by the way@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CSo long.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009What the heck? Hey, wait a minute!
I was telling you not to leave suddenly!@0003@000C@0010@0110@000CWhat do you want?@0003@0009Well, nothing in particular. I just thought
we could chat@0016...@0016or something.@0003@000CWell, THAT doesn't sound very productive 
nor strategically important, but@0016...@0016@0003
If you want to, please go ahead.@0003@0009OK. Um. Let's see. What to talk about.@0005
You know, my mom used a little magic, too.@0003
She passed away a while ago@0016...@0016@0003
But, that's why I thought I might be able
to use magic, too.@0003
Last time, you said no right away, but
you hadn't heard the whole story.@0003@000CDo you want to be a mage?@0003@0009No, not exactly.@0003@000CWell, then you should keep following 
your own instinct instead.@0003
Everyone has his or her own talent.@0003
I figure the path you are taking now is 
appropriate for you.@0003@0009Yeah.@0016...@0016
@0017Maybe you're right.@0003
Well, it's not like I was torn between 
the two or anything.@0003
I kinda just wanted to talk with 
a female mage like you. Thanks.@0003@0017@000CUm, you're welcome, I guess.
I'm glad I could be of your service.@0003

strange as ever. @0003@000CThank you very much.@0003@0009That wasn't a compliment!@0005
Have you always been like this?@0003@000CYou mean, have I always been brilliant?
Well, I've been me. So, yes.@0003
I've been surrounded by books for as long 
as I can remember.@0003@0009You studied magic since you were a kid?! 
Did you do anything for fun?@0003@000CWell, there's my monk-watching habit.@0003@0009Huh? Never mind.
How about your mother and father?@0003@000CI don't have any memory of my parents.@0003
But according to my grandmother, they are
traveling in distant lands.@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017So you have a grandmother. 
What is she like?@0003@0017@000CShe's like an elegant goldfish that's been
sun-dried with a wildflower.@0003@0009I have no idea what you're talking about.@0003@000COK then. So long.@0003@000C@0011@0009Hey!@0004
@0009@0080@000C@000AHey, Lute!@0003@000C@0010@0110@000CYes?@0003@000AYou may be a great mage, but 
you don't seem to be physically strong.@0003
So, from now on@0016...@0016 Well@0016...@0016
@0017I'll be at your side to protect you.@0003@0017@000CWell, that's very kind.@0003
But you know that the more likely scenario 
is that I'll be protecting you.@0003@000A@0080@000C@000AThat's not what you're supposed to say!
You're just supposed to say Yes!@0003@000COK. Yes.@0003@000AMan@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I might not seem that tough now,@0003
but someday I will grow up to be a man as
strong as my dad. You wait and see!@0003@0017@000COK. I'll look forward to it.@0003
But I won't get my hopes too high.
Disappointment is a cruel mistress.@0003@000AYou! Grrr!

This was a sneak attack, wasn't it!@0003
Then prepare yourself for battle!@0003@0009Oh, no! Please listen to me!@0003
It's true that I am from Grado, 
but I am now on your side!@0003@000CYou must think I'm pretty gullible!
You can't trick me like that!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009But I'm telling the truth! I am on your side! 
I didn't attack you.@0003
I tripped and fell into you, but it was
an accident!@0003@000CRight@0016...@0016@0005
Let's say for a second I buy this story.@0003
But how can you explain tripping when
there's nothing around to trip on?@0003@0009There was a dent over there, and--@0003@000CHuh?@0005
Oh, you mean that.@0003
I see. You tripped on that thing, huh?@0003@0009Y-yes!@0003@000CHow could you have tripped on that?
I can barely even see it!@0003
Hey, isn't that spear a little heavy for you?
You're so small. Need a little help?@0003@0009Not really. It's much lighter than 
other knights'.@0003
I'm working on building up more power,
but I'm getting the hang of it.@0003@000CHmmm@0016...@0016
I noticed that your armor is very shiny.@0003@0009@0017Um, yes. Thanks, I guess. I'm always
polishing it.@0003@0017@000CThat's a sure sign of a new recruit!
Watch out for hazing.@0003
You might as well be wearing a sign taped
to your forehead that says I'm a rookie!@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016 Um@0016...@0016@0003@000CDon't worry. I've got your back.@0003@0009What?@0003@000C@0017But in exchange, you must cover ME when
someone attacks me with a sword!@0003@0017@0009Oh@0016...@0016 OK. I'll do my best!@0005
Um@0016...@0016 Say@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat is it?@0003@0009@0017Thank you@0016...@0016@0005
for believing me that I'm not your enemy.@0003@0017@0017@000C@0017There's no point in fighting with

getting better at battle.@0003@0009Yes. It's mostly because you and others 
are helping me out.@0003
I'm also getting the hang of my spear.@0003@000CI see. I was once a rookie too.
Everyone has to start somewhere.@0003
We're young, and we start at the
bottom of the chain, you know?@0003

us. So let's work hard, all right?@0003@0009Yes!@0003@000CGood, good.
Oh, by the way@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yes?@0003@000C@0017I have something for you.
Now, where did I put it? Hmm@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Ah, here it is.@0003@0009Thanks@0016...@0016 Um, what is it?@0003@000C@0017Isn't it obvious? It's a necklace.@0003@0017@0009@0017I can see that, but@0016...@0016 @0017Why?@0003@000C@0017I bought it.
I mean, I bought it a long time go.@0003
There was a kid selling this on the street, 
and he just wouldn't leave me alone.@0003
I didn't need it, but he seemed really 
hungry, so@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009That's very kind of you, Ross.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Oh, it's not a big deal. 
A-anyway, it's yours now.@0003@0017@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009What?! I couldn't!@0003@000CNo, it's yours.@0003@0009But@0016...@0016@0003@000CDon't you like it?@0003@0009It's not that. It's very pretty! It's just@0016...@0016@0003@000CThen keep it.@0003@0009Thank you.@0003
@0009@0080@001E@0009@0002@0017It's so lovely.@0003@0017@000CYou should have just accepted in the first
place. Why are you acting so reluctant?@0003@0009@0080@0017@0009Well, I've always lived very@0016...@0016modestly.@0003@000CHuh? What's that got to do with it?@0003@0009I could never afford something like this@0016...@0016

precious to you@0016...@0016@0003@000CI see.

We're in the middle of a battle!@0003@0017@0009The others are fighting well, so the

If something does happen, we'll be OK.@0003@000C@0017Well, I'm pretty confident in my

@0017That's a surprise.@0003@000C@0017Hey!@0003@0017@0009Why don't you prove your dedication
by answering this brainteaser?@0003@000C@0017Like a riddle? Sounds fun!@0003@0017@0009Yes. It'll be really fun to watch you
struggling to come up with an answer. Ha!@0003@000C@0017Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
Well, whatever. Let's do it.@0003@0017@0009OK, here it is.
Ross, do you know what a balance is?@0003@000C@0017Of course I do! Who doesn't?@0003
It's a type of scale with small plates
on both sides to put weights.@0003
When both sides are the same weight,
it balances.@0003
So that was the riddle? Easy!@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha! You're too funny! No, that was 
just the setup for the brainteaser.@0003
Here's the real question.
Assume there are 25 pebbles.@0003@000C@0017Pebbles?@0003@0017@0009Yes, they're really small. As small as peas.
They are all the same color and shape.@0003
In this group, there's one pebble that's
lighter than all the other pebbles.@0003@000C@0017And I must tell you the way to 
find that pebble?@0003@0017@0009Of course not. 
What kind of challenge is that?@0003
The question is, how many times do you need
to use the balance to find that one rock?@0003@000C@0017How many times? Uh@0016...@0016
It's not@0016...@001624, is it?@0003@0017@0009What?!@0006
@0009@0080@000B@0009@0080@000B@0009Oh! Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's the first time I've heard that one!@0003
I see. So you were thinking that you'd 
measure the pebbles one by one!@0003
That's great, Ross! You're too funny!@0003@000C@0017That's not a compliment, is it.
You think I'm an idiot!@0003@0017@0009That's not true.@0005
Actually, it is. Ha ha ha!@0003
And did I mention how
perceptive you are, too?@0003@000C@0017Oh, you! Just you wait! I'll figure it out!
I just need some time to think about it.@0003@0017@0009The anticipation is killing me.@0003
# 0x0CC3
@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0109@000CHey, you!@0003@0017@0009Oh, hi, Ross.@0003@000C@0017I have an answer for your brainteaser!@0003@0017@0009You got it, huh? That's amazing!@0003@000C@0017Y-yeah.
The answer is@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Yes, yes?@0003@000C@0017Four times!@0003@0017@0009You must have worked really hard to figure
that out!@0003@000CSee! See! I told you I'd get it!
Fighting's not the only thing I'm good at.@0003@0009However, that's not the correct answer.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017What do you mean?
I can't believe it! Ugh!@0003
If that's not the right answer, then 
what is?@0003@0017@0009You were close. 
The right answer is three times.@0003@000C@0017Only three times?
How? Tell me!@0003@0017@0009The key is how many pebbles you put on the
scales at first.@0003
First, put eight rocks each on either side 
of the scale.@0003
The side with the lighter rock will be
higher than the other, right?@0003
Or, if the sides are balanced, it means that
the lighter rock is in the rest of the pile.@0003
So that was one turn on the balance. 
The rest is pretty easy to figure out.@0003
Let's assume that the lighter rock was
in the remaining pile of nine rocks@0016...@0016@0003
Then you'd put three rocks on each side of
the scale. So that's the second turn.@0003
If either side of the scale tips, then
the rock is in one of those two piles.@0003
If the scale is balanced, then the rock
is one of the remaining three rocks.@0003
So, now you've figured out which group
of three pebbles has the lighter one.@0003
What you do now is put one rock from this
pile on each side of the scale.@0003
Like before, if the scale tips to one side, 
the lighter pebble is on the scale.@0003
If the scale is balanced, then the
remaining pebble is the lighter one.@0003
And that was the last turn on the
scale. Did you get all that?@0003@000C@0017Huh? Well, I think I got it@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009What?! I just explained it all very clearly.
You still don't get it? That's really@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Really what?!@0003@0017@0009Um, nothing. Forget it. A ha ha ha ha!@0003@000C@0017A ha ha ha what? 
What do you mean forget it?@0003@0017@0009Anyway, it's been fun hanging out.
Let's get together again sometime, OK?@0003@000CIt wasn't fun for me at all! Hey!@0003
# 0x0CC4
@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0109@0017@0009Hi, Ross.@0003@000C@0017Oh, it's you again.@0003@0017@0009That brainteaser was fun, huh?
Did you get it yet?@0003@000C@0017I already told you I didn't
have any fun!@0003
If that's what you consider fun, you
must have had a pretty bad childhood!@0003@0017@0009Well, I was an orphan.@0003@000COh@0016...@0016@0003@0009My sister and I were abandoned when I was
really young, before I could even talk.@0003
She became a dancer and raised me all on
her own.@0003
I'm really grateful for her.@0003@000C@0017You were an orphan?@0003@0017@0015@000C@0080@001E@000C@0017I-I'm sorry. I had no idea.@0003@0017@000C@0080@001C@0009How could you know? Don't worry about it.
I don't even remember being abandoned.@0003
And because of that, I got a chance to 
travel around, and meet lots of people.@0003
Like you. So, I'm not sad at all.@0003@000C@0080@001E@000C@0080@001C@000C@0017I see@0016...@0016@0003
@0002@0017@000C@0080@0017@000C@0017Hey, I just had a great idea.
Let's be brothers?@0003@0017@0017@0009Huh?! Like blood brothers? I'm really not
into slicing myself up for people I just met.@0003@000CNo, no, no. Just, you know, brothers!
Now call me Bro, Bro!@0003@0009Um@0016...@0016 OK@0016...@0016Bro.@0003@000CSay it like you mean it!@0005
Oh, never mind. It'll just sound forced.@0003@0009I told you so.@0003@000CWell, just call me Ross for now.@0003
@0017But, you can consider me a brother
from now on.@0003@0017@0009What do you mean by that?@0003@000CI mean that I will be a friend who
you can rely on and trust completely.@0003@0017@0009That's very kind, considering I really
haven't known you for very long.@0003
But thank you. You're a nice guy, even
if you're not very sharp.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Hey! No need to insult me!
A simple Thanks, Bro will be enough!@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha ha ha. You're so funny!
By the way, do you have a girlfriend?@0003@000C@0017W-what! Of course not! Did you forget? 
We're in the middle of a war right now!@0003
I have to focus on that!@0003@0017@0009Huh.@0005
A ha ha ha ha!@0003@000C@0017What's that for?
How about you? Do you have one?@0003@0017@0009I have a lot of them!@0003@000C@0017What?! A lot of them!
Oh well. We're still pretty young.@0003
Better to not get tied down.@0003@0017@0009Good luck, Ross!@0003@000C@0017Don't talk like it's not your problem, too!@0003@0017@0009Hey, Ross.@0003
I think we're going to be friends for a long
time. In fact, I know it.@0003@000COK. Boy, you're such a laid-back guy@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0CC5
@0009@0010@011B@000C@0010@0109@000CUm@0016...@0016 Ahem.@0003
Are you Sir Gerik by any chance?@0003@0009What do you want, boy?@0003@000C@0017Oh, my name is Ross.
I'm the son of warrior Garcia.@0003@0017@0017@0009I see@0016......@0016
So, Ross, are you an axeman?@0003@000CYeah! Don't be fooled by my appearance.
I'm actually pretty good.@0003@0009Ha ha ha! If you say so.@0003@000CWell, I think so. 
But it's important to keep improving.@0003@0009Why is that so important to you?@0003@000CMy father is such an amazing warrior.@0003
I've always wanted to be worthy of
the title son of Garcia.@0003
And I want to be able to go home and 
rebuild my village.@0003
After that, I want to go on a voyage and
train in the open ocean.@0003
And after that, I'd like to go back home.@0003
To do all this, I need to be the best
warrior I can be.@0003@0009Those are admirable goals. 
I'll help you out sometime.@0003@000CHow? You'll give me a lesson?@0005
@000C@0080@000E@000CAre you serious? That's great!@0003@0009I might not be able to beat your father,
but I could teach you a thing or two.@0003
Why don't you try landing a hit on me?@0003@000CThat'd be great! But before we start,
let me go practice on those guys first!@0003@000C@0011@0005@0009It's great that he's so eager to learn,
but he's really not ready to go solo yet!@0003
# 0x0CC6
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@011B@0017@000CRoss, didn't you say that you wanted to go 
on an ocean voyage to train yourself?@0003
The sea is a great place to train because
it strengthens both the mind and body.@0003@0009Have you ever been on a voyage?@0003@000COf course. I've escorted many commercial 
ships before.@0003
It's embarrassing, but I got seasick for 
the first few days.@0003
That was very painful.
But I got used to it in a few days.@0003
It was a long trip. Nature was more brutal
than the enemies who pursued us.@0003
But after the voyage ended, I realized that
I grew up a lot.@0003
The sea is an amazing combination of 
brutality and expansiveness.@0003@0009Now I definitely want to go on a 
sea voyage.@0003@000CBy the way, Ross, how's your injury from
our last session?@0003@0009Oh, that little thing? It healed right up!@0003@000CHa ha ha@0016...@0016
You sure are tough, boy!@0003@0017@0009Sir Gerik?@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009What should I do to be strong like you?@0003@000CThat's a tough question@0016...@0016 I would 
have to say that it's all in the mind.@0003@0009Mind?@0003@000CIf your desire to win is stronger than your
opponent's, you've already won.@0003
Your mind is your most important weapon.@0003@0009Come to think of it, I have noticed that.@0003
At our last lesson, before we even started,
I was thinking that I could never win.@0003
I guess it was like admitting defeat before
even trying.@0003
@0017All right! You've convinced me!@0003
I'll start strengthening my mind as well
as my axe skills.@0003
Thank you, Sir Gerik.
I can't wait until our next lesson!@0003@0017@0009@0011@0005@000CHis energy is refreshing, but I must teach
him patience next time.@0003
# 0x0CC7
@0009@0010@0109@000C@0010@011B@0009Hey, Sir Gerik@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat is it, Ross? You seem down today.@0003@0009Why is the sword stronger than the axe?@0003@000CWhat are you talking about?
Just use a stronger axe to beat a sword.@0003@0009That's not what I mean!@0003
I want to be strong enough to split
a silver sword with an iron axe.@0003@000CYour father@0016...@0016@0003@0009What about him?@0003@000CHe could defeat many swordsmen
with just one axe.@0003@0009So you've seen him in battle?@0003@000CJust once.
He was leading a unit of the Renais army.@0003
He was swinging his axe at the front line.@0003@0009@0017Wow, my dad was really strong, wasn't he!@0003@0017@000CHe was more than just strong. 
He was like a war god.@0003
I have to be honest with you, Ross.
I was on his enemy side at the time.@0003@0009What?!@0003@000CI was a mercenary hired by the other side.@0003
It was a fierce battle against Garcia's
unit, and we ultimately had to retreat.@0003
Come to think of it, this is a perfect 
example of the power of the mind.@0003
You see, I was so intimidated by Garcia that
I had lost even before I started.@0003
That was an unforgettable failure for me.@0003
After that, I swore to myself that I would 
be as strong as him with a sword.@0003@0009Wow, I can't believe Dad beat you down 
like that! He's the greatest.@0003
But you're pretty great, too.@0003@000CSomeone who lost to your father?@0003@0009@0017Yeah!@0003
You might have lost that time, but you 
became a great swordsman because of it!@0003
OK. I'm going to stop moping around.@0003
From this moment on, I swear that someday 
I will destroy swords with my axe.@0003
You are my witness, Sir Gerik!@0003@0017@0017@000CTruly, you are the son
of the warrior Garcia.@0003@0009That's not all! I'm also the best student of
the master swordsman Gerik!@0003@000CWhen did you become my student?@0003@0009When I met you!@0006
Oh!@0004 Enemy detected!@0003
I'll catch you later!
Give me another lesson someday, Sir Gerik.@0003
I'll be much stronger by then, and maybe
I'll win a match with you!@0003@0009@0011@0006@000C@0017I believe he will surpass Garcia someday.@0003@0017

tried to shoot me.@0003@0017@0009W-well, Colm@0016...@0016@0003

fruit from our tree.@0003@000CHe really taught me how frightening
an archer with a good shot can be.@0003@0009But@0016...@0016 He never hurt you.@0003
He just wanted to scare you. 
He missed on purpose.@0003@000CNo, he was aiming for me. I was 
just too fast for him to hit me.@0003@0009He never missed a target 
when we went hunting.@0003@000CWell, then, I guess I'm just 
faster than wild animals.@0003@0009Hee hee! Ha ha ha!@0003@000C@0017Hey! You're laughing at me, aren't you?@0003@0017@0009Hee hee! That's not true@0016...@0016@0003

You've always been such a crybaby.@0003@0009Yes, but@0016...@0016@0003
Because you were there with me,
I was never sad@0016...@0016@0003
@0009@0080@001D@0009When Grandpa died, you were by my side
the whole time, holding my hand@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Neimi@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009@0080@001C@0009Thank you, Colm. For then

If anything is troubling you,
come see me first, all right?@0003
I'll take care of anyone who
makes you cry.@0003@0009I will@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CI think your haplessness is permanent.
But don't worry, I'll take care of you.@0003@0009@0080@001D@0009Oh! Sniff@0016...@0016 Colm@0016...@0016
Sniff@0016...@0016@0003@000COh, no. I made you cry again, didn't I.@0003@0009Sniff@0016...@0016 Yes@0016...@0016
But for different reasons this time.@0003@000CThat's better.@0003@0009Sniff@0016...@0016@0003@000CNeimi@0016...@0016@0003

@0009@0010@010C@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017Hey, you!
Have you seen a scary-looking woman?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Scary-looking woman?
Is she your sister?@0003@0009@0017NO. 
I don't have any sisters.@0003
The woman I'm talking about was 
beautiful, but also very scary.@0003
Have you seen someone who fits that
description?@0003@0017@000CI don't think so.@0003
Beautiful but very scary@0016...@0016
What do you mean by that?@0003@0009@0017Well, I'm not exactly sure, either.@0003
I just heard from one of Gerik's mercenaries
that there is a woman sword fighter here.@0003
Apparently, she's very talented and was 
hired for an unbelievable sum.@0003@0017@000CA woman sword fighter??@0003@0009@0017Rumor is that if you speak to her
without thinking,@0003
she's likely to attack you out of nowhere!@0003@0017@000CIs that so.@0003@0009@0017Maybe her face is scarred from
fighting. Yeah, that's probably it!@0003
She's beautiful, but has a very sad
past behind that scar.@0003
And that's why she's so scary!@0003@0017@000CA scarred face?
A sad past?@0003@0009@0017Or maybe it's because her lover was
killed, and she's trying to avenge him.@0003
That seems equally plausible, doesn't it?@0003
Anyway, if you see her around, would you 
tell her that I was looking for her?@0003
See ya.@0003@0017@0009@0011@0006@000CWell, I'm the only female sword fighter
here. I guess he was looking for me.@0003
He is so clueless@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0CCC
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Oh, hi, Marisa!
I'm sorry for what I said the other day.@0003
I figured out that you were the scary
woman I was talking about.@0003
I'm Colm. Nice to meet you.@0003@0017@0009OK.@0005
So, what did you want from me?@0003@000C@0017Oh, nothing special.@0003
I just wanted to meet the famous
swordswoman.@0003
I was going to challenge you to a match,@0003
but I've seen you fight and know how good 
you are. You'd beat me senseless.@0003@0017@0009I'll accept a match with you anytime.@0003@000C@0017Well, I don't know how else to say this.@0005
@0017You're scaring me.@0003@0009Scaring?@0003@000CYeah. It sounds funny, but you never
look at the enemy@0016...@0016@0003
I mean@0016...@0016you don't care about the
enemy at all.@0003@0009I have no idea what you're talking about.
Speak English.@0003@000CI mean@0016...@0016 Even when the enemy is
right in front of you,@0003
you aren't even looking at him. 
You're fighting something else.@0003@0009Something else?@0003@000C@0017I'm not that smart, and I don't know 
much about swords.@0003
So I can't say exactly who or what it is
you are really fighting.@0003@0017@0009I see.@0003@000C@0017Um@0016...@0016 What I mean to say is 
good luck in all your battles. Um@0016...@0016@0003
That's it. See you later!@0003@0017@0009The enemy@0016...@0016I'm really fighting?@0003

the other day.@0003@000C@0017You mean about you not fighting the
enemy in front of you, but something else?@0003
Is that what you're talking about?@0003@0017@0009Yes.@0003@000C@0017What about it?@0003@0017@0009Do you want to know?
What I'm really fighting with?@0003@000CHuh? Y-yeah@0016......@0016
@0017If you want to tell me, sure.@0003@0017@0009What I'm really fighting with is@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009My father.@0003@000CYour father?!@0003@0009Well, to be more precise, his shadow.@0003@000CWas he a swordsman also?@0003@0009He was one of the most famous swordsmen 
in Jehanna. He was also a mercenary.@0003@000C@0017I see why you're so good.@0003@0017@0009Ever since I was a child, my father 
taught me how to live as a mercenary.@0003@000CSince you were a kid?@0003@0009The harsh conditions of Jehanna breed
strength and ruthlessness.@0003
The only way to survive is by being 
a mercenary.@0016@0003@0016@000COh.@0003@0009My father is my parent, my teacher, and 
above all, a mountain I must conquer.@0003@000CA mountain?@0003@0009Once I conquer the mountain, I can
accomplish anything I want.@0003@000C@0017That must be a@0016...@0016big mountain.@0005
So, where are you on the mountain?@0003
A third of the way up? Halfway up?
Or can you already see the summit?@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016I'm only at the base.@0003@000C@0017You still have a long way to go, huh?@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016Yes.
I don't even know where the summit is yet.@0003@000C@0017Well, then, you don't know how long 
it will take, do you?@0003@0017@0009I'll just keep climbing. 
Even if it takes me forever@0016...@0016@0003@000COh. I see.@0003
@0017Well, good luck. I'm sure you'll make 
it to the top.@0003@0017@0009Yes. Someday. For sure.@0005
You're@0016...@0016a nice guy.@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha! Oh, please.
You're embarrassing me.@0003@0017
# 0x0CCE
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@010C@000C@0017Hey, you! I know your secret.@0003@0017@0009Huh?@0005
My secret?@0003@000C@0017You're a thief, too, aren't you?@0003
Do you think that's acceptable behavior
for someone in the princess's entourage?@0003@0017@0017@0009Ha ha ha! Where'd you learn a big word
like entourage, boy?@0003
Not that it's any of your business,@0003
but Her Highness already knows about 
my@0016...@0016hobbies.@0003
You're not, by any chance, trying to
threaten me, are you?@0003
That's funny. I never thought I'd be
reprimanded by a boy!@0003@000C@0017Hey, old man, don't you talk down to ME!@0003
@0017I'm not a boy. I'm Colm!
And I'm not threatening you, either.@0003
I was just surprised that you're a thief
because you dress so nicely.@0003@0009I assume you're in the same trade. 
Those rags are a dead giveaway.@0003
Well, you may not take any pride in your
appearance, but I'm different.@0003
Do you see this jacket?@0003
It has silk embroidery, a trend that 
I started in Carcino.@0003
Where are the stitches, you ask?@0003
They're on the inside of the jacket.
But I'm not going to show you.@0003
The truly cultured man cares about 
every detail.@0003
It would be a waste of my time to even
try to explain it to a poor urchin like you.@0003@000CWhy are you bragging about something
so lame?@0003
@0017And I'm not a poor urchin! Man, I've 
never met anyone as annoying as you!@0003@0017@0009Oh, don't be so sensitive, little urchin.@0003
If you want to be like me, make more money.
Improve your skills.@0003
The name of the game is making money. 
Money is all that matters.@0003
It's your only way out.
Work hard and escape from poverty.@0003@000CFirst of all, I don't want to be like you!
Second of all, I'll show you!@0003@0009Well, don't pull a muscle, little urchin!@0003
# 0x0CCF
@0009@0010@0124@000C@0010@010C@0017@0009Hey, urchin, have you made any money yet?@0003@000C@0017Stop calling me urchin!@0003
@0017I heard that your dad is a wealthy 
merchant in Carcino.@0003@0009Yes. So what?@0003
My father is a wealthy merchant,
and his son is a thief.@0003
Great family, huh?@0003@000C@0017If you're rich, you don't need to steal.
You can just buy whatever you want.@0003@0017@0009You are so green, boy. Greener than the 
fruit I left out for a month.@0003@000C@0017What's that supposed to mean?@0003
I've never had dried fruit, so I don't
know what you're talking about!@0003@0017@0009Oh, that's too bad.@0003
@0017Listen, urchin. Merchants are always
stingy. It's part of who they are.@0003
And my father was especially stingy. 
He gave us nothing for free.@0003
We had to work for everything we had.@0003
So my brothers and I learned the value of
hard work from a young age.@0003
@0017And this just happens to be my job.
Get it?@0003@000C@0017It's not easy being the son of a 
merchant, huh?@0003
Forced to work from a young age.
I had a tough childhood, too. @0003
I always had to hunt and garden with 
my dad.@0003
@0017I guess our lives aren't so different 
after all, huh.@0003@0009Er, a little hunting and gardening 
is quite different from actual work.@0003
You can see that just by looking
at how you and I turned out.@0003@000C@0017Well! I'll show you!@0003
Maybe you'll wake up one morning and find
that something important to you is gone!@0003
Consider yourself warned, old man!@0003@0017@0009You know,@0003
warning people of your plans isn't really
the most effective thieving strategy.@0003
Anyhow, I look forward to seeing
what you can muster.@0003
# 0x0CD0
@0009@0010@010C@000C@0010@0124@0017@000CHi there, urchin.
I haven't heard you bragging in a while.@0003
I thought maybe you gave up on your 
big plans.@0003@0009I'm more persistent than you think I am.
I came to see you because I remembered--@0003
@0017Wait, you haven't noticed yet?@0003@0017@000C@0017Noticed what?@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha! I won!@0003@000C@0017What? Did you actually steal something?@0004
Don't tell me@0016...@0016@0005
@0017@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017A ha!@0003@0017@0009So you finally noticed!@0003
Yes, I secretly stole only the embroidery
off your precious jacket.@0003
So, how's that for stealth? That's some
pretty fine thieving, if I do say so myself.@0003@000C@0017I see. The embroidery IS missing.
Good work.@0003
@0017It's a little early for a victory
celebration, though.@0003
The embroidery was of a pony, correct?@0003@0009@0017Huh? Yeah@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CUnfortunately for you, that was a fake.@0003
I knew you would try to steal it, so I
replaced it with a fake beforehand.@0003
The real embroidery is of a phoenix.
But I won't show it to you. Nope, never.@0003@000C@0080@000F@0009@0017You! That's a cheap trick!@0003@0017@0009@0080@000C@000DIn this business, anything goes.@0003
However, I'm impressed that you got
as far as you did.@0003
I definitely don't want you for an enemy.@0003@000AHeh heh heh@0016...@0016 Same here, I guess.
I'm glad that we're on the same side.@0003
Now give me my boots!@0003

It's about Princess Eirika.@0003@0017@0009Is something the matter with her?@0003@000C@0017It was a while ago, but when she went 
to bed, she was@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009What happened after she
retired to her room?@0003
Colm, don't toy with me.
Just tell me!@0003@000C@0017The princess looked like she was 
having trouble falling asleep.@0003
She kept pacing.@0003@0017@0009Having trouble falling asleep?@0016@0003@0016@000C@0017Yup.@0003@0017@0009That's not good.@0003
It's very important for her to get enough
rest during this tough march.@0003
This war has been very hard for
Prince Ephraim and Princess Eirika.@0003
I'm sure she's probably spent a few 
nights worrying, but--@0003@000C@0017Hey! I just remembered that I have this
secret remedy my mother used to make.@0003
It started off as a freckle cream,@0003
but it turns out that it works pretty well 
with insomnia, too.@0003@0017@0009Really.
That's a good idea.@0003
I'm sure Prince Ephraim and Lady Eirika
would love to have something like that.@0003@000C@0017OK, then. I'll give it to her next
time I see her.@0003
I'll let you know how it goes.@0003@0017@0009All right, Colm.@0003

like news or anything.@0003@000CIt's big news for me! And for you, too!@0003
The future of Renais is not looking good
if he hates studying as much as I do.@0003@0009Don't worry about it.@0003
He might not like studying much, but
no one is as bad as you.@0003
Besides, if you're bringing this up to
denigrate him, you are in serious trouble.@0003@000CNot at all!@0003
@0017I'm just worried about Prince
Ephraim and Princess Eirika.@0003@0017@0009I understand.

Her name is Meriella!@0003
You send letters to her all
the time, don't you!@0003@0017@000COh, that. I've been meaning
to tell you about her.@0003@0009@0017I'm so glad to hear that, Kyle. Let me 
know if you need to talk to someone.@0003
Long-distance relationships can be hard.@0003
I can't believe it! 
Stuffy old Kyle is in love!@0003@0017@000CIn love? Me?
I think you're confused.@0003
Meriella is not my girlfriend.
She is one of my teammates.@0003@0009@0017Workplace romance, is it?
Say no more. I understand.@0003@0017@000CJust shut up and listen to me.@0003
Meriella is the alias we use for Renais
knights on undercover missions.@0003@0009Alias? Like a secret code?@0003@000CPrecisely.@0003
We send mail addressed to Meriella, which 
only the Renais knights know.@0003
The contents are always the same:@0003
We let them know that Prince Ephraim and 
Princess Eirika are safe.@0003
It's all written in secret code.
That's the letter I was sending.@0003@0009Even though we're in the middle of a war,
does it really have to be so complicated?@0003@000CYes. Better to be safe than sorry.@0003@0009@0017I see.@0003
Well, would you like me to deliver that
letter?@0003@0017@000CNo. Every single soldier is
important in this war.@0003
We need you here.@0003@0009@0017Really?
You value my service? Neat!@0003@0017@0017@000CUm@0016...@0016 Yes.@0003
Although you do bring me some pointless 
tidbits, you have also been a big help.@0003@0009Great! This is so encouraging!@0003
Until recently, I thought I'd never have
any real connection with the knights.@0003
But it's different now.@0003
Now, I consider everyone involved in this 
war, especially the knights like you,@0003
to be my friends.
I will always fight for my friends!@0003@000CThank you, Colm.@0003
Civilians and knights@0016...@0016
Together, we'll restore peace in Renais.@0003

if I see any, I'll pick some for you.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Ha ha! That's great! Now we've got
something to look forward to, hm?@0003@0002
Oh, we'd better get back to the battle.@0003@000CAw@0016...@0016 All right, Amelia. But
let's talk some more again.@0003@0009@0017Oh, you bet!@0003
I'm really glad I
met you, Neimi.@0003@0017@000CMe too, Amelia.@0003
# 0x0CD5
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@0119@0009@0017Amelia, can I ask you a question?
Why did you become a soldier?@0003@0017@000CHm? Well@0016...@0016 It's@0016...@0016
I wanted@0016...@0016to become strong.@0003@0009Strong? What do you mean?@0003@000CAll my life, I've felt helpless, like
I needed someone to defend me.@0003
I didn't want to feel like that anymore.@0003
@0017But what about you, Neimi?
What are you fighting for?@0003@0017@0009I'm not really sure how I wound up
getting involved in this whole war.@0003
@0017It just@0016...@0016sorta turned out
that way, you know?@0003@0017@0017@000CIt doesn't matter how you wound up here.
Your skill with the bow is amazing, Neimi.@0003
I'm not sure how to put this, but@0016...@0016@0003
You seem more battle ready than most
of the trained soldiers I've met.@0003@0009Hmm mm mm@0016... @0016Thanks. My grandpa
taught me everything I know.@0003@000CReally?@0003@0009We used to go hunting together
when I was little@0016...@0016@0003
Oh! That reminds me!@0003
I used to have a pet fox, a little
kit I found out hunting one day.@0003@000CWow! A fox kit?@0003
I've never seen one before.
Was it cute?@0003@0009He was adorable! So small, and he had
such soft and fluffy fur.@0003
It was so cute watching him try to run
his fastest on those short little legs.@0003@000CTee hee.@0003@0009What about you? Did you
ever have any pets?@0003@000C@0017Me? Well, I don't--
Oh!@0003
@0017I did! I used to have
a little pet bird.@0003@0009Oh, what kind?@0003@000CHm. Well, she had beautiful
feathers, I remember that.@0003
They were all blue and yellow and
orange. She used to sing to me.@0003@0009She was a songbird? That sounds nice.@0003@000CIt was. Whenever I felt lonely, she
would sing her song to cheer me up.@0003
I let her go when I left my village
and joined Grado's army.@0003@0009That's so sad@0016...@0016@0003
I think I'd like to get another
pet when this war is all over.@0003@000CReally?@0003@0009Definitely. You should get one, too.
Once this war is over, I mean.@0003
When everything is at peace again,
we should each get a pet.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CThat sounds great! And then we can
have our pets visit one another.@0003@0009I'd like that.@0003@000CMe, too.@0003
# 0x0CD6
@0017@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@010A@0009I just noticed something, Neimi.@0003
There are a lot of female soldiers
traveling with us, aren't there?@0003@000CYou know, you're right!@0003@0009It's nice to see. It wasn't like
that in Grado's army.@0003
It makes me feel much more at ease.@0003@000CI was really nervous when I started up, but
then I spoke more with the princess@0016...@0016@0003@0009I've started noticing that some of the
women are getting@0016...@0016friendly with the men.@0003
I thought it was, you know, just the
camaraderie of the field or whatever.@0003
But I'm starting to think that's not
the case, if you know what I mean.@0003
@0017I'm starting to think maybe
it's something else entirely.@0003@0017@000CHee hee hee@0016...@0016
So, um@0016...@0016 Is there any boy you like?@0003@0009@0017Hm? Why do you ask? Or@0016...@0016is it
that you have someone YOU like?@0003@0017@000C@0017I do.@0003
He's someone who's always watched
over me, stood by my side.@0003
He used to make me cry, but
I@0016...@0016I love him.@0003@0017@0009That's amazing! You know, I'm
a little jealous of you@0016...@0016@0003
Have you told him how you feel?@0003@000C@0017Uh-uh@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Well, you have to tell him! I'm
sure he likes you, too, Neimi.@0003@000C@0017I will. Someday.@0005
@0017Not today. But someday, I will.@0003@0009There you go.@0003@000C@0017But you never answered my question!@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017What, me?
I@0016...@0016er@0016...@0016@0003
I honestly never really spoke to
any of the men in Grado's army.@0003@0017@000CBut you're not in Grado's army
anymore! What about now?@0003@0009@0017Huh?
Oh, er, well@0016...@0016@0003
@0017@0009@0080@001E@0009I'm@0016...@0016not so sure@0016...@0016@0003@000CHa! You do, don't you!@0003@0009@0017Uh@0016... @0016Mm-hm@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CDon't worry. I'm sure he
likes you, Amelia.@0003@0009@0080@001C@0009@0017Why do you say that?@0003@0017@000CWell, you're so@0016...@0016 You're so
cute, and you're so nice.@0003
How could anyone NOT like you?@0003@0009@0017Neimi@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Thanks. That's really sweet of you.
I'm happy to hear you say that!@0003@000CBe sure you tell him how you feel!@0003@0009You, too! I'm not the
only one suffering here!@0003@000CHee hee hee. All right.
We're in this together!@0003

introduction has been so delayed.@0003
And please, just call me Artur.
Brother is too formal.@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016@0003
All right, Artur it is.@0003@000CVery good.
@0017Ack!@0003@0017@0017@0009What is it?@0005
What's wrong?@0003@000COh, nothing. Sorry.@0003
But@0016...@0016that hand mirror
hanging from your waist@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Oh, this?
It's a keepsake from my mother.@0003
I had it stolen from me once, so
I've made this leather strap for it.@0003
I can tie it to my belt and take it
with me everywhere now.@0003@0017@000CIt's@0016...@0016 Excuse me, but may
I look at it for a moment?@0003@0015@000C@0080@000D@000BHm@0016...@0016@0007
Yes, well, that is interesting.@0003@0002
If my memory serves, this is quite
a valuable mirror.@0003
It is a gift given only to clerics
of the highest order.@0003
Few of these mirrors exist, and for
you to have one means your mother@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Yes, she was a cleric@0016...@0016
@0017When I was young, an illness@0016...@0016@0003@000BSay no more. I understand.@0003
@0017But seeing you and the mirror
she left you tells me something.@0003
Your mother was a good person,
benevolent, faithful, and caring.@0003
And you are the product of her
care, filled with the same light.@0003@0017@0017@0009Thank you@0016...@0016 It makes me
happy to hear that.@0003@000BI'm delighted to have met you.

Yes, I'm happy to see you.@0003@0009That's an impressive bow. Am I to
understand that you're an archer?@0003
I've heard the others speak highly
of your skills.@0003@000CThank you. And I was watching you use
your magic. It was pretty incredible!@0003@0009Oh, it was nothing. I'm just a novice.@0005

Here@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Oh@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017I've been asking around since
the last time we spoke.@0003
I found out that our convoy master had
found a mirror lying on the ground.@0003
When I asked to see it, imagine my
delight when I saw it was your mirror!@0003@0017@0009@0080@001E@0017@0009@0016...@0016Sniff@0016...@0016 I'm so@0016...@0016
so happy!@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003
You know, when I was looking for
your mirror, I was reminded@0016...@0016@0003
I had a similar experience when I was
young. It's why I chose to be a monk.@0003@0009@0080@001C@0009@0017What happened?@0003@0017@000C@0017One day, when I was just a little boy,
I had lost a toy, and I was crying.@0003
@0017I lived near a monastery, and one of
the monks saw me sitting there weeping.@0003
He spent his day trying to find out why
I was so sad and to cheer me up.@0003
It was so trivial--that toy was nothing
but a trinket, but to me, it had value.@0003
I later found out a friend of mine
had taken it without asking, but@0016...@0016@0003
Anyway, I was very happy that someone
had stopped to show so much concern.@0003
To everyone else, I was just a petty
child weeping over a toy.@0003
To this monk, however, I was a sad and
lost soul, crying out in need.@0003
He was so kind, and he spent so much
of his day on a child's tears.@0003
I admired his attitude, even then.@0003
It was then that I realized that I could
honor his deed by becoming a monk.@0003@0009And@0016...@0016that's why@0016...@0016@0003@000CYes, that's why.@0003
@0017Oh! Your mirror!@0003@0017@0015@000C@0080@000D@000BHere you go.@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@000C@000A@0016...@0016
I'm@0016...@0016really happy@0016...@0016@0003@000BAh. Just as I thought.@0003@000A@0017What?@0003@0017@000BYour smile is delightful. It's a
vast improvement on those tears.@0003
The heavens themselves must have
wanted to see that smile@0003
and conspired to help me find
your mirror.@0003@000AThank you, Artur@0016...@0016
I'm so grateful.@0003@000BNo, Neimi.@0003
I'm grateful to you. Talking to you
makes me feel at peace.@0003
I feel like@0016...@0016some of the others make
light of me from time to time.@0003@000AOh, that's only@0016...@0016 It's just because
you're so honest and pure of heart.@0003
Someone I know@0016...@0016teases me a lot,
too. All the time, he teases me.@0003@000B@0017I see@0016... @0016I'm sorry to hear that.@0003@0017@000AWell, it's not that he's all bad.
He can be very kind, but@0016...@0016@0003
But you're kind, too, Artur.@0003@000BThank you.@0003
You know, when you meet someone, that
person reflects back at you@0003
like a mirror, revealing within them
the emotions that you project.@0003
Angry people bring out the anger within
others, just as sullen, hopeless people@0003
bring out nothing but the sorrow within
all those to whom they speak.@0003
Do you know why so many people seem
kind to you, Neimi?@0003
It is because you yourself are a kind
person. You bring that out in others.@0003@000AOh, Artur@0016...@0016 That's so kind--
I mean@0016...@0016 Er@0016...@0016 Thank you.@0003@000BPlease, Neimi, always hold that
kindness close to your heart.@0003@000AI will@0016...@0016@0003

I was just observing this
chemida beetle.@0003@000CYou haven't changed at
all, have you, Lute?@0003@0009What do you mean?@0003@000CYou spent most of your time sequestered
in your room, studying your books.@0003
On the rare occasion you went outside,
you were paralyzed with fascination.@0003@0009Of course! There are so many fascinating
things to be learned from nature!@0003
There are a great many books out there,
and I have read most of them, of course.@0003
But I've found that what is written can
differ greatly from how things truly are.@0003
Take this chemida beetle, for example.@0003
I've been reading from The Glossary
of Falibrian Entomology lately.@0003
According to the glossary, their wings
fall off once they reach maturity.@0003
However, I have just found an adult
beetle whose wings still work perfectly!@0003
Exceptions do exist to the rules my
books outline. This is a rare specimen.@0003
I wonder, should we take it back with us?@0003@000CSigh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I hope this isn't another
of your pranks.@0003@0017@0009My@0016...@0016pranks?@0003@000CDo you remember when I loaned
you my copy of Lux Aeterna?@0003
You replaced my bookmark with
the tail of a sedgel lizard.@0003
You scared ten years off my
life, I swear it!@0003@0009Did I do that?@0003@000CAnd! Knowing full well that I
have a@0016...@0016mild@0016...@0016fear of spiders,@0003
you caught a small army of them
and unleashed them in my room!@0003@0009I thought that if I immersed
you in the thing you feared,@0003
maybe you might be able to
overcome your fear entirely!@0003
And I went to a lot of trouble
trying to catch those spiders!@0003@000C@0016...@0016Why would you do that?@0003@0009@0017Well, I did get a bit of a kick
out of the experience myself.@0003
Why? Did it bother you?@0003@0017@000CYES!@0005 @0017Oh, don't worry about it.@0003
At least you did it because
you cared about me, right?@0003
I'll just accept it as the best gesture
of kindness you can manage, Lute.@0003@0017

In this day and age, we're fighting
monsters from the legends and epics?@0003
I know how much is at stake, but
sometimes@0016...@0016I get so tired.@0003@0009When you're tired, there's nothing better
than a good meal and a long sleep.@0003
And if you look at page 990 of De
Floris Mysticis, there's a special@0003
herb that, once decocted into a potion,
will help relax your muscles.@0003
Look for the parfina flower, and reduce
it into a thick syrup before drinking.@0003
Oh, and I hear music helps you sleep.
If you like, I can hum something for you.@0003@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
However, I think I'll pass on your offer,
delightful though your humming must be.@0003
You must be tired as well. Take care
of yourself, and rest when you can.@0003@0017@0009I will.@0003
In fact, maybe I'll just
hum to myself instead.@0003
Will you be all right?@0003@000C@0017I'm fine. I feel quite
refreshed, in fact.@0003@0017@0009Refreshed?@0005 How so?
Was it some new kind of magic?@0003@000C@0017Perhaps, from a certain point of view.@0003
Your every word has nurtured my soul@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Hm.@0003
I'm not sure I get it, but as
long as you're feeling better!@0003

@0009@0010@0110@000C@0010@011A@000C@0017Hello, Lute.@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWhat is it? You look like you
have something on your mind.@0003@0009Oh.@0005@0003
No. I was just thinking
about monsters.@0003@000CMonsters?@0003@0009Yes.@0003
All these monsters are our enemies, I know,
but@0016...@0016they're not all bad, are they?@0003@000CWhat are you talking about?@0003@0009They're kind of cute, don't you think?
I mean, like those revenants, for example.@0003@000C@0017It's fair to say I will never
understand your tastes.@0003
Besides, I thought you enjoyed
using them as, well, magic practice.@0003@0017@0009Oh, I do. I do indeed.@0003
I use my magic to rip them to
shreds@0016...@0016with love, of course.@0003@000C@0017Your way of expressing love
is somewhat frightening@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Do you think so?
Thank you.@0003@000C@0017No@0016...@0016 That wasn't a compliment.@0003
@0016...@0016@0003
Should I, ah, expect you to
attack me with magic, too?@0003@0017@0009Hm?@0003
Why would I attack you
with my magic?@0003@000C@0017You don't get it?@0003@0017@0009No.@0003
Your strange logic baffles even
my brilliant, brilliant mind.@0003
That's why I'm curious.@0003@000C@0017Really? You don't get it?@0003@0017@0009No, I don't!@0003@000C@0017You really don't?@0003@0017@0009Stop that!@0003@000C@0017I'm just giving you a hard
time, Lute.@0003
All right. I'll just come straight
out and say it.@0003@0017@0009Finally!@0003@000C@0017It's because I like you.@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009What!?@0003@000C@0017In fact, I love you, and I'm
hoping perhaps that you love me.@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009Oh!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Oh!!!@0003@000C@0017Now, do you understand?@0003@0017@0009Er@0016...@0016@0005 Um@0016...@0016@0005 A-according to A Young

What I mean is@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017What's wrong with you? I don't
often see you lose your cool.@0003@0017@0009Th-that's because@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Yes?@0003@0017@0009@0080@001E@0009Well@0016...@0016@0003

Ha ha ha ha!!!@0003@0017@0009@0080@001D@0009I'm sorry. I'm a little out of
my depth when it comes to love.@0003@000CNo, you're not.
Love needs no textbooks.@0003
Just be yourself, and listen
to your feelings.@0003@0009@0080@001C@0009Is@0016...@0016that all I need to do?@0003@000C@0017I promise.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0005

for a moment. I won't bite.@0003@0017@000F@0080@000E@000CHow may I help you, my lady?@0003@0009@0017Would you spin yourself
around right there?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016What? Spin around?
Like@0016... @0016Like this?@0003@0015@0004@000C@0080@000E@0007@0009@0017Hm@0016...@0016 Not bad. Not bad at all.
You have a graceful form.@0003
And you're quite beautiful.@0003
It'd be a waste to let you
stay a simple clergyman.@0003@0017@000CBeautiful? Me?
Do you really think so?@0003@0009@0017Yes, you have a lovely face.@0003
Say@0016...@0016 Would you like to dance with
me? I think you have the potential.@0003
I could use a partner. When this
war ends, I think it should be you.@0003@0017@000CI@0016...@0016don't know about that.
Dancing probably isn't my thing.@0003@0009@0017You never know until you try.@0003
Anyway, from what I can see, I
think you've got what it takes.@0003
Trust me. There's no future in
this church business. Be a dancer.@0003@0017@000CI'm afraid I have to disagree.
I feel this is my calling, you see.@0003
Er@0016...@0016 If that's all you wanted,

T-Tethys?@0003@0009@0017That's right. I'll see
you later, child.@0003

No? I'll show them to you again. Pay
attention, as you'll be going next.@0003@0017@0009Tethys, we're in the middle of a
battle. Can't this wait until later?@0003@000CMy, aren't we confident! No, we
can't have that. We have to practice.@0003
I refuse to have a partner who's
too lazy to practice daily.@0003@0009No, you're not following me. I'm
not your partner. I don't want to--@0003
Would you please stop calling me
child in front of everyone!@0003@000C@0017What's wrong with looking young?@0003@0002

skin. May I@0016...@0016touch your cheeks?@0003@0017@000C@0080@000C@0009@0080@000A@0008Oh@0016...@0016 Ah, normally, people wait for
an answer before they start@0016...@0016er@0016...@0016@0003

rub manon leaves on after I wash.@0003@000A@0080@000D@000BManon leaves? Those scratchy things?@0003

too hard?@0003@000DWell, here@0016...@0016 Take a look.@0003@0009I'm not sure this is the right time.

Oh, it brings back such memories@0016...@0016@0003
He and I couldn't have been much
older than, say, ten.@0003@0017@000A@0016...@0016Are you telling me I look
like a ten-year-old child?@0003@000C@0017Yep. Those sparkling eyes are

love teasing you.@0003
However, I am serious about you
becoming a dancer.@0003

It's a pleasure.@0003@0017@0009So@0016...@0016 Interested in wyverns, are you?@0003@000CIt's not so much interest as it is,
well, fascination, if you will.@0003
The way how they fly in the sky at will@0016...@0016
and their powerful limbs.@0003
I've seen them from a distance before,
but I've never seen one up close@0016...@0016@0003
Do you think it would mind if
I were to touch it?@0003@0009@0017Nah, go right ahead.@0003
@0017But wyverns can be proud. They won't
warm up to anyone they think unworthy.@0003
Took me three years before this one
would let me ride on his back.@0003
Oh, he hated me at first. Always
snarling and snatching at me@0016...@0016@0003
I don't know how many times he
threw me when I tried to ride him.@0003@000CR-really? Maybe I should
keep my distance then.@0003@0009@0017No, he seems to like you.@0003@0017@000CHow do you know?@0003@0009@0017He hasn't tried to eat your
face yet, for one thing.@0003

you call it, fascination?@0003
Yeah, maybe it won't take too
long for you two to be friends.@0003@0017@0017@000CHm. Well then, it's very nice
to meet you, Sir Cormag's Wyvern?@0003@0009His name's Genarog. Next time
you're around, come say hi.@0003@000CThanks. I will!@0003

@0017@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0113@0009Sir Cormag!@0003@000CIf it isn't Artur.
@0017What's the rush?@0003@0017@0009I've been thinking about how to
become friends with Genarog.@0003
I was thinking perhaps he might
like it if I gave him something.@0003@000C@0017You want to give Genarog a gift?@0003@0017@0009Yes. It's an amulet made of a star stone.@0003
According to legend, those who carry
star stones are blessed from above.@0003
It's customary to wear them as amulets
in Renais, and I thought@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017I see@0016...@0016 But that's your amulet,
isn't it?@0003@0017@0009No need to worry for me, Sir Cormag.
I pray every morning and every night.@0003@000CWell, if that's the case, then we'll
take it. Look at that, Genarog!@0003
All right, Artur, I want you to
place it in his saddlebag.@0003@0009@0017I'm a little scared, but
@0017I'll give it a try!@0003@0009@0080@000C@000A@0017All right@0016...@0016 The saddlebag@0016...@0016
This one right here?@0003
@0007There you go@0016...@0016
@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Sir Cormag, look! Genarog
licked my hand!@0003@000CWhoa, not bad@0016...@0016
Not bad at all, Artur.@0003
I've never once seen him
lick anyone's hand but mine.@0003@000A@0017Really?@0003@0017@000CYeah, and it took him two years
before he'd even do that!@0003
You and he seem to be getting
along famously, as they say.@0003@000AThat makes me happy, Sir Cormag.
I'm glad he likes the amulet.@0003@000CI think he likes you more than
he likes that amulet, honestly.@0003@000AReally, Sir Cormag?
May I talk to him again?@0003@000CSure, anytime. We're looking
forward to it. Both of us.@0003
# 0x0CE2
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0113@000CI should apologize to
you, Artur.@0003@0009What's wrong, Sir Cormag?
Did something happen?@0003@000CThe star-stone amulet that you
so generously gave Genarog@0016...@0016@0003
It got shattered when an
archer attacked us.@0003
It's not all bad, though. That
stone stopped the arrow cold.@0003
Saved both me AND Genarog, it did.@0003
Had that amulet been not there,
we wouldn't be here right now.@0003@0009That's unfortunate, but
@0017I'm glad the amulet worked!@0003
I'll have to make a prayer of
thanks for the stone's protection.@0003@0017@000C@0017Well, we owe you, Artur.@0003
@0017And it's not exactly a
perfect trade, but@0016...@0016 Here.@0003@0009What's this?@0003
@0015@0009@0080@000C@0006@000AThis@0016...@0016 This looks like
a wyvern stone!@0003@000CA wyvern stone? Are they rare?@0003@000AYes, very! Where on earth
did you@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Genarog had it.@0003
I didn't have any idea what it was.@0003
I figured maybe you'd know something
about it.@0003
And it looks like I was right,
wasn't I? You know what it's worth?@0003
Well, like I said, it's yours.
Keep it.@0003@0017@000AA-are you sure!?@0003@000C@0017Sure. You don't mind, now,
do you, Genarog?@0003@0017@0017@000ATh-thank you@0016...@0016
I mean it@0016...@0016@0003
Sir Cormag, Genarog@0016...@0016@0003
Wyvern stones are like dragonstones,
only far more rare. Mages covet them.@0003
Having one focuses your powers,
refines your magical control.@0003
But nobody knows where they come
from or how to craft them.@0003
There are no more than a handful of
wyvern stones in the world today.@0003
I never thought I'd even see one,
much less hold one in my hands.@0003@000C@0017So it's a big deal, eh?@0003@0017@000AIt most certainly is, Sir Cormag.
Genarog@0016...@0016 I can't thank you enough.@0003
You've made one of my dreams
come true.@0003@000CI'm glad we were able to
help you, Artur.@0003@000AI'll cherish this wyvern stone always.@0003@0015@0006@0017@000A@0016...@0016By the way, Sir Cormag,@0003
@0017do you have a dream?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016My dream. Hmph@0016...@0016@0005@0003
My only dream right now is to undo
the damage Grado has done.@0003
I want Grado to be a peaceful nation
again, ruled by a gentle man.@0003@000A@0017I'm sure you'll see your own
dream realized, Sir Cormag.@0003
After all, we're all fighting
to make that dream come true.@0003
You and Genarog have made my
own dream a reality.@0003
And you know that I'll do what
I can to make yours real, too.@0003@0017@0017@000CGenarog was right. You are
a good lad, Artur.@0003
Tell you what. If we do restore
peace, you must visit my homeland.@0003
And when you do, I think Genarog
would like to take you flying.@0003@000AI'd love to, Sir Cormag. I look forward
to visiting Grado in better times.@0003

@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@011A@0009@0017Hey, you there.@0003@0017@000CYes?@0003@0009@0017You a monk or something?@0003@0017@000CYes. I came from Renais.
My name is Artur.@0003@0009@0017I'm Joshua.@0003
So, uh@0016...@0016 You want to
make me a bet?@0003@0017@000CA bet?@0003@0009@0017Sure! Call it in the air:
heads or tails?@0003@0017@000C@0016...?@0016@0003@0009What's the matter? All you have to do is
say heads or tails. So what's your call?@0003@000CI have no idea what this is
about, but I'll say heads for now.@0003@0009@0017Right, so I get tails.
Here, we'll flip now.@0003
Annnnnnd@0016...@0016@0003
@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Right!
Tails. I win.@0003@0017@000CYou win. Um@0016...@0016 What
do you win?@0003@0009@0017Well, now, you have to
do whatever I tell you.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000CWhat? Why do you say that?@0003@0009You lost, right?@0003
@0017Since you lost, you've got
to do what I tell you.@0003
So when this battle's over,
I want you to train with me.@0003@0017@000CTrain? What are you talking about?@0003
Look, I only said heads because
you pressed me to!@0003
I don't remember you saying anything
about what we were betting on.@0003@0009@0017You shouldn't worry so much
about the tiny details!@0003
You'll waste your life, worrying
so much! Now, about that training.@0003@0002
I always have a tough time fighting
against people who use magic.@0003
I think it's got something to
do with getting the timing right@0016...@0016@0003
I don't really need to polish my
technique too much.@0003
However, I've noticed that these
battles just keep getting harder.@0003
So, I figured I should train with
someone who can use a little magic!@0003@0017@000CI commend your attitude, but
I really can't help you@0016...@0016@0003
My evenings are pretty full
as it is, so@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Hey, now! A deal's a deal. I'll
be waiting, so don't be late!@0003@0017@000CFine@0016...@0016@0005
But just for a little while!@0003
# 0x0CE4
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@012A@000C@0017Hey, Artur.@0003
I wanted to thank you for training.
I learned a lot from it.@0003
I hope you're not too exhausted
for today's training session.@0003@0017@0009Well, actually@0016...@0016
Could we not do this today?@0003@000CHey, now. Show a little
enthusiasm, why don't you?@0003
@0017An attitude like that ain't
gonna win you any battles!@0003@0017@0009You may be right, but I just
can't keep up with you.@0003
If you keep exhausting me in
training, I'll be no good@0003
when the real fighting begins.@0003
I'm trying not to let it show,
but I'm really worn out today.@0003@000C@0017Then let's make a bet.
If I win, you do what I tell you.@0003@0017@0009Joshua, I'm quite drained, and
we still have much fighting to do.@0003
You should just rest tonight.@0003@000C@0017Don't worry about me, Artur.
So, heads or tails?@0003@0017@0009Fine@0016...@0016 Heads.@0003@000C@0017Great! You're heads, and
I'm tails. Here we go!@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Incredible!@0005
Tails! I win again!@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0005
Could I see that coin?@0003@000CWhat for? Are you suggesting
that I would actually cheat?@0003@0009@0016...@0016No. Sorry.@0003@000C@0017So it's a deal. I'll be waiting
for you tonight. Don't forget!@0003@0017@0009Fine@0016...@0016@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0010@012A@000C@0016...@0016You're hopeless.
Don't look so tired.@0003
It gets me all worried, and I can't go
back to the front being all worried.@0003
@0017Listen, just take a day off.
Get some rest, all right?@0003@0017@0009But I lost the bet.@0003@000C@0017The deal was, if I win,
you do what I tell you.@0003
And what I'm telling you
to do is take it easy.@0003@0017@0009Joshua@0016...@0016
@0017I appreciate it.@0003
I've never done much fighting.
I think I'm just worn out.@0003
It's exhausting, having to keep
your guard up all the time.@0003
But your kindness has rejuvenated
my frazzled nerves a little.@0003@0017@0017@000CWell, we're still fighting, so
don't let your guard down.@0003
Stick close to me today, and
I'll watch over you.@0003
But don't skip tomorrow's training!@0003@0009I'll be there.@0003
# 0x0CE5
@0017@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@012A@000CHey, Artur! You're looking pretty
pleased with yourself today.@0003
Care to make a bet?@0003
If I win, we'll hit the training
again tonight.@0003@0009No need for bets, Joshua.
I'll be happy to train with you.@0003@000CYou're volunteering?@0003
Are you feeling all right? Did
you take a blow to the head?@0003@0009No, no. I'm fine. I'm just
offering to help you out.@0003
It's easier than losing
another bet to you.@0003@000CWhat do you mean? You've
got even odds of winning.@0003@0009You must be joking!@0003
Out of the past 21 coin flips,
I've won two, and you've won 19!@0003
Those are impossible odds to beat,
so there's only one answer.@0003
You must have some divine
betting power or something.@0003
If I can help you train, I will,
but I don't want to lose anymore.@0003@0017@000CHmph@0016...@0016
But that's no fun!@0003
All right, you don't have to train
with me if you don't want to bet.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Excuse me?@0003@000C@0017I don't have any divine power.@0003
You've won 11 out of 21 coin tosses
so far. We're about even.@0003
I was@0016...@0016cheating. Just
a little, though.@0003@0017@0009You cheated? I felt so guilty
when I accused you earlier.@0003
I guess I just trusted--@0003@000C@0017Yep. That's your problem.@0003
I know trust and faith are
important to you monkly types.@0003
However, on the battlefield,
you can never trust your foe.@0003
If we were gambling for your
life, and not for training,@0003
you'd be dead 19 times over.@0003
Well, I mean, you can only die
once, but you get my drift.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0005
I'm speechless@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha. Good thing I'm
a reasonably fair man, huh?@0003
No harm done, and you even learned
a little something, didn't you?@0003@0017@0009I suppose.@0003@000C@0017So here's the deal. I want
you to keep being my partner.@0003
But this time, I'll be teaching
you a little bit about wagers.@0003@0017@0009What's more important to you, Joshua?@0005
Gambling or training?@0003
@0017I guess I don't even have to ask
you that, huh? But no more cheating!@0003@0017

You've been at my back for days.
I can't help but notice!@0003

I've been researching you.@0003
I also plan to find out your
Achilles' heel before too long.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Why would you do something like that?@0003@000CBecause there's no one better than me.@0003@0009I'm sorry?@0003@000CI said there's no one better than me.
And if there is, I have to stop him.@0003
I can't have you threatening my
natural superiority here.@0003@0009Threatening your--@0003@000CI've seen you. You use magic, and
that makes you competition.@0003
And you use dark magic, which
makes you the enemy of light.@0003@0009That's a common misconception,
actually, about dark mages.@0003
@0017And besides, we're allies here.@0003@0017@000CNo, not until we make it clear
who is superior.@0003@0009Oh, fine@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat, you think you're better than me?@0003@0009I never said that!@0003
Look, we're on the same side here.
Does it matter who's better?@0003@000CMatter? Of course it matters! How
could you possibly think it doesn't?@0003
Personally, I think I'm clearly
superior to you. Don't you agree?@0003@0009Do what you like.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
That was close. You were

talking to me?@0003@000CThere's nobody else
here, is there?@0003@0009And who are you?@0003@000CI beg your pardon.@0003
I should have introduced myself.
Kyle, of the Knights of Renais.@0003@0009Ah, I see. And I am Lute, mage
of profound genius.@0003@000CVery well, Lute.
The pleasure is mine.@0003
To tell you the truth, I've
been looking for you.@0003@0009Has someone issued a search notice?
Or is there a bounty on my head?@0003
Or is this perhaps a private matter?@0003@000CI@0016...@0016guess it would be that last one.
I have a favor to ask.@0003@0009What would it be?@0003
My requests are classified into
seven categories and 25 items.@0003@000CI don't know how it would be classified,
but@0016...@0016I want you to help us fight.@0003@0009Why?@0003@000CI'm a strong believer that morale is
best served by good leadership.@0003
A unit of knights, all trained
by Renais's finest generals.@0003
But we're fighting no ordinary foe,
and we need more diverse skills.@0003
That's where you come in.@0003
Because you can use magic, you
could be invaluable in helping me@0003
develop unique battle strategies.@0003@0009So that's what you wanted
me for, is it?@0003@000CHow about it? Would you do it?@0003@0009Sure. Anything you say.
I don't mind.@0003@000CI should warn you, I spend my
time on the front line.@0003
I ride out to meet the enemy head-
on rather than attacking from afar.@0003
It's a much riskier prospect than
supporting from the rear guard.@0003
Is that going to be a problem?@0003@0009I have no objections.@0003@000CExcellent! I appreciate your help.@0003
I expect we'll be able to generate
some stunning tactics together.@0003
You don't need to stay at the front
the whole time.@0003
I'll give you a cue when to approach.@0003@0009Got it.@0003
I'll do whatever you say.@0003@000CI'm counting on you.@0003@0009You have nothing to worry about.
There's no one better than me!@0003

a great help to us all.@0003@000CWell, of course I have! I told you
there's no one better than me!@0003@0009Magic is an incredibly
powerful force, isn't it?@0003
Sturdy armor, tough hide, it
makes no difference to magic.@0003
I'm in awe of it.@0003@000CYou're not so bad yourself.
You're an incredible fighter.@0003@0009Thanks.@0003@000CHave you trained a lot?@0003@0009Yep.@0003
When I was young, there was a lad
I hated losing to.@0003
Every day, I trained harder and
harder in hopes of defeating him.@0003@000CSo what happened? Did you
finally beat him?@0003@0009Uh@0016...@0016@0003
Not as such, no. But I haven't
lost to him in a while, either.@0003
We're evenly matched. I think
we force one another to improve.@0003@000CI see.@0003
It's always good to have someone
against whom you measure yourself.@0003
Aren't you glad you have this
personal adversary?@0003@0009@0017Uh-huh.@0003
@0017You know, I think this is the
longest conversation we've had.@0003@000CReally?@0003@0009Well, uh@0016...@0016@0003
Not to sound rude, but I didn't take you
as the kind to be interested in others.@0003@000CNo, it's not rude at all. I just@0016...@0016
got a little interested in you.@0003@0009I see.@0005

How are you holding up, Lute?@0003@0009No problem, sir.@0003
I could keep this
up all day!@0003@000CThat's good to hear.@0003
But don't push yourself@0016...@0016
@0017You're vital to my strategy!@0003@0017@0009Of course I am! There's no
one better than me!@0003@000C@0017I'd have to agree. This would be
a lot harder without you along.@0003
@0017This might seem forward, but@0016...@0016@0003
What do you do when you're
not, well, fighting in wars?@0003@0009Me? Oh, I'm a student of magic.@0003@000CI guessed that much. What I mean
is, do you have any hobbies?@0003@0009Hobbies?@0003@000CThat's right.@0003
@0017Take me, for example. I like to collect
carved figurines of animals.@0003
I have a small collection of them back
home at Renais.@0003
How about you?@0003@0017@0009Does monk-watching count?@0003@000CMonk-watching?
What are you talking about?@0003
Maybe I should ask a different question.
Do you have any favorite foods?@0003@0009Out of everything I've had, curry
of dried toad is my favorite.@0003@000CEr@0016...@0016right@0016...@0016@0005
Do you enjoy cooking?@0003@0009I don't cook much, but I'm
sure I'd be good at it.@0003
I mean, I can cook with a single
word, no fire necessary!@0003@000C@0017Ha!@0003@0017@0009I'm sorry?@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha ha!
I never get bored talking to you.@0003
I can't explain it, but I find
you so refreshing!@0003@0017@0009Really? I like talking
to you, too.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
Lute.@0003@0009Yes, sir?@0003@000CWhy don't you come to Renais
once the war is over?@0003@0009Why not?
No objections.@0003@000C@0017Ha! No objections? That's your
answer? Well, all right, then.@0003
Let's focus on getting through
this war first, though.@0003@0017@0009Yes, sir.@0003@000C@0017I'm glad to have you with us.@0003@0017@0009Me, too, sir.@0003

I do what little I can, but

# 0x0CEF
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0129@0009Master Knoll@0016...@0016@0003@000CI know you@0016...@0016 You're
Natasha, from the temple.@0003@0009Yes. I remember seeing you
many times back in Grado.@0003
@0017But this is the first time
we've ever actually spoken.@0003@0017@000C@0017I don't know what it is, but clerics and
mages seem to be like oil and water.@0003
@0017And we mages can be an enigmatic bunch
at times. Shadowy and sinister@0016...@0016@0003
Or at least, that's how I've always
imagined you clerics saw us.@0003@0009Oh, no! I never--@0003
Well, no. You're right. We had few
dealings with the mages.@0003
But that's in the past. I have
a question for you, Master Knoll.@0003@000CI think I can guess. It's about the
Sacred Stones and Prince Lyon, is it?@0003@0009It is.@0003
My mentor died@0016...@0016trying to warn us about
the threat our Sacred Stone posed.@0003
I want to know the truth.@0003
What is Emperor Vigarde up to? What
is Prince Lyon's role in this?@0003@000CThere are as many truths out there
as there are people to tell them.@0003
@0017Perhaps it's best simply to choose the
truth with which you are most comfortable.@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CIn the eyes of your mentor, I would
imagine we must have seemed quite evil.@0003
He imagined our magical studies using
the Sacred Stone were sacrilege.@0003
I suspect he quite loathed the
ancient magics he called dark.@0003@0009You're wrong@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@000C@000AMy mentor wasn't like that at all!@0003
And isn't this war the direct result
of all your dark magic research?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@000A@0016......@0016@0003@000CHm@0016...@0016 Well, I suppose
you are right about that.@0003
Your magic stems from faith in the
unknowable, the divine presence.@0003
In contrast, dark magic stems from
knowledge, from understanding.@0003
We distrust what we do not understand,
and we strive to know the unknowable.@0003
Perhaps our disciplines truly
are incompatible.@0003@000A@0016......@0016@0003
# 0x0CF0
@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0129@000C@0016...@0016Our researches ended in
miserable failure.@0003
Grado's Sacred Stone was shattered.
Prince Lyon, corrupted@0016...@0016@0003
And this whole tragedy that unfolds
around us even now.@0003
It's true. We mages have triggered
this age's greatest calamity.@0003@0009But why? What was it all for?@0003
What did you hope to accomplish
with the power of the Sacred Stone?@0003@000CAll Prince Lyon wanted was to help
people@0016...@0016and we are his servants.@0003@0009Help people?@0003@000CWe read of a spell entitled the time shear.
It causes, in effect, a hole in time.@0003
This spell warps time, punches a
hole through cause and effect.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWe lack the knowledge to reproduce
this ancient spell today.@0003
Prince Lyon, however, was convinced
that we could unravel its secret.@0003
He felt we could use it to predict--
and even prevent--future events.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Prevent@0016...@0016the future?@0003@000COh, we dedicated years to studying
this spell.@0003
You see, the greater the disaster, the
farther it sends ripples through time.@0003
We learned to read these ripples from
the future, hoping to save lives.@0003
If we could know when a disaster would
strike, we could evacuate people.@0003
We could save millions of lives.@0003@0009But@0016...@0003
It seems so, so blasphemous.@0003
That worldly creatures should
take control of fate, it--@0003@0016@000CAre you saying that, knowing the
future, we should do nothing?@0003
We should simply allow people to
die in order to preserve fate?@0003@0009I@0016...@0016@0003@000CI'm sorry. I don't mean to
sound hostile.@0003
Prince Lyon himself was troubled
by these same doubts, you see.@0003
But we pressed on with our studies.@0003
We felt it was our duty, in the
interest of all Grado's people.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CPerhaps we were bitter that we
receive no credit for aiding Grado.@0003
That we receive no accolades for our
research, for the benefit it brings.@0003
I do not know. But we pressed on,
nonetheless.@0003
The misconceptions linking the ancient
magics to evil die hard and slow.@0003
Prince Lyon sought to change that.@0003
He wanted, as we all wanted, to
prove that our magic had good uses.@0003@0009Prince Lyon would never--@0003@000CWith our aid, Prince Lyon predicted
a great storm rising in the south.@0003
He barred ships from leaving port,
and, oh, how the people complained.@0003
But the storm came, and the seas
raged. We saved countless lives.@0003
And Prince Lyon cared not at all
if the people loved him for it.@0003
He only wanted them to be safe.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CAnd now, I see it all so clearly.
All our research amounts to nothing.@0003
All I can do now is lament our
hunger for knowledge. Our greed.@0003

I have told you all that I know.@0003@0009I'm not sure you did.@0003
You said that you could see@0016...@0016ripples
of future disasters, is that it?@0003
And the greater the disaster, the
more clearly you could read it?@0003
Does that mean you saw something?
Some tremendous disaster to come?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009And in knowing about the disaster,
Lyon thought he could prevent it.@0003
Could he have@0016...@0016@0003
Was he studying the Sacred Stone to
find a way to prevent this disaster?@0003@000CAnd what will you do, now
that you know this, too?@0003
Haven't you called such
knowledge blasphemous?@0003@0009I@0016...@0016don't know what to do.@0003
If my mentor were here, I think
he might be able to guide me.@0003
But I'm still so inexperienced.
I feel lost in this dilemma.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009But how can I not act on this?@0003
If I do nothing, knowing that
something terrible will happen@0016...@0016@0003
If I could have helped@0016...@0016
I@0016...@0016 I don't know what to do.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Within five years, half of
Grado will be destroyed.@0003@0009Destroyed?@0003@000CIn the southern half of the continent,
there will be a terrible quake.@0003
The ground will shake violently.
The earth will crack open wide.@0003
Cities will fall. Fields will
burn in the earth's hot blood.@0003
Few will survive.
This is what we have foreseen.@0003@0009How-- How can this--@0003@000CI advise you to leave Grado.@0003
You might be able to escape the disaster
if you head north to Renais or Frelia.@0003@0009No@0016...@0016
I can't do that.@0003
When this disaster strikes, people
will need help and healing.@0003
If I could help them even a little
by staying behind@0016...@0016@0003@000CYou would willingly risk certain
death to save a handful of people?@0003@0009If I died serving Grado, I would
have no regrets, Master Knoll.@0003
Thank you for sharing this. I will
make the most of this knowledge.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
Spoken like a true cleric.@0003
You would drop everything without
hesitation just to help others.@0003
This is the difference between mages
and priests. Knowledge versus sacrifice.@0003
@0017Perhaps you might allow me to join
you when the time comes@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Master Knoll?@0003@0017@000CIf I am to honor Prince Lyon's
intentions, I cannot flee this.@0003
I am not sure how best I can help,
but I do not want anyone to die.@0003
Not if, by my action, I can save them.@0003@0009I understand how you feel,
Master Knoll@0016...@0016@0003
Let our strengths be united,
then, for the common good.@0003

call out, and I'll be here.@0003@0009I shall remember that, Cormag.@0003

@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0113@000CHey, it's Natasha, right?@0003@0009Yes, that's right.
@0017How is the kitty doing?@0003@0017@000CI took him back to his mother.@0003
I figured he belonged back
with his mom.@0003@0009@0017I agree.@0003@0017@000CHow about you? Where are
your parents in all this?@0003@0009I haven't seen them since I
joined the clerical order.@0003
We would write, but it's been a
while since I heard from them.@0003
I wonder how they are. I've
been worried about them.@0003@000CAre you from Grado, Natasha?@0003@0009Yes, I am.@0003@000C@0017I thought so! You know what?
That's where I'm from, too!@0003
@0017Where were you born? I'm
from the south myself.@0003@0009I was born in a village
near the Renais border.@0003@000C@0017Ah, well, you've got nothing
to worry about then.@0003
When I joined the army, I was
stationed near the border.@0003
Worst thing you've got to worry
about there is bandits.@0003@0017@0009Really?@0005
That's so good to hear.@0003
@0017Thank you for telling me
that. I get so worried.@0003@0017@0017@000CAh, there. That's a nice
smile you've got there.@0003
Cheers me up just looking
at it, it does.@0003
Don't worry too much about
your parents, Natasha.@0003@0009I won't, Cormag. And
thank you. I mean it.@0003

@0009@0010@0111@000C@0010@0113@0009@0016...@0016Hello, Cormag.@0003@000CWhat's the matter? You've got
your gloomy face on again.@0003@0009Doesn't this all get hard for you?@0003@000CThis what?@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
Ever since this started, we've been
fighting nothing but Grado soldiers.@0003
These are our countrymen.
Our families@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009Every battle we win, I see only how
many casualties we've caused.@0003
I'm a healer, but to win this, I
must turn my back on my countrymen.@0003
I have to let them suffer, when
all I want to do is help them.@0003
But@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016But what?@0003@0009Grado is responsible for all of
this. Our homeland@0016...@0016@0003
Grado has caused so many deaths now.
We have no choice but to fight.@0003@000CAh. You see it now. That's the
sad irony of the battlefield.@0003
I ride a wyvern and use my spear to
bring low men who should be my allies.@0003
We each joined this cause in hopes of
bringing Grado to its senses.@0003
Our country has set the world on its
ear, and it's up to us to right things.@0003@0009I suppose@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
You know something, Natasha?@0003
You should never be ashamed of
the fact that you're from Grado.@0003
You have no debt to pay, no burden
of guilt to bear.@0003
Grado was once a magnificent country.
Do what you can to restore that glory.@0003
It took only a handful of men to turn
Grado down the wrong path,@0003
but perhaps a mere handful of soldiers
can set things right again.@0003@0017@0009I understand, Cormag. I'll do what
I know to be right, no matter what.@0003
I feel like a heavy fog has been
lifted from my heart. Thank you.@0003@000CAh, I just wanted to see that lovely
smile on your face again.@0003
You and me, we've got lots to talk
about, I think. Let's do this again.@0003@0009I'd love to.@0003
# 0x0CF5
@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@010F@0009Hey, you're Prince Innes, aren't
you? I'm Joshua. Nice to meet you.@0003@000CI'm sure.@0003@0009@0017Well, now that we know each other@0016...@0016@0003
What say we play a quick game
of chance, hm?@0003@0017@000CHm? What are you planning
on doing with that coin?@0003@0009@0017We're gonna have a little
wager. What else?@0003
If I'm going to fight alongside
someone, I want to know him.@0003
And there's no better way to get to
know someone than a friendly wager!@0003
So@0016...@0016 What do you say to a
starter bet of@0016...@00161,000?@0003@0017@000CBetting? Here? You can't be serious.@0003@0009@0017Hey now. I always take gambling
seriously. Always.@0003
Whether you live or die on the
field often comes down to luck.@0003
Every fight, you're putting your
life in someone else's hands.@0003
You should be glad to meet up
with such a lucky guy.@0003@0017@000CYou may rely on luck, but
I prefer raw skill.@0003
However, we might as well. Put
your money where your mouth is.@0003@0009@0017Now you're talking!@0003
Right, here we go!@0003
@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009@0006@0017Heads or tails?
What's your call?@0003@0017@000CTails.@0003@0009Let's see what we've got@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Oh, well. It's heads.@0003
Too bad, Your Highness. You lost.@0003@0017@000CWhat? That's impossible.
I saw--@0003@0009@0017C'est la vie.@0003
Look closely. See? It's heads.@0003@0017@000CThat's strange@0016...@0016@0003
My eyes never fail me, but
I could have sworn--@0003
@0017Hm. There seems to be more to
betting than meets the eye.@0003@0017@0017@0009Figure that out already?
You're a quick study.@0003@000CYeah.@0003
Let's try that again.
I'll get it this time@0016...@0016@0003

@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@010F@000CTails.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Heads again.@0003
That's ten losses in a row.@0003@000CI don't care. Next bet.
Double or nothing. Tails.@0003@0009Shouldn't you stop soon?@0003
Maybe you've got the cash back
home, but you're on the road.@0003
And I'm willing to bet you're
not carrying that much on you.@0003@000CNo, keep going.@0003
I don't feel like quitting
on a bad streak.@0003@0009Fine, fine@0016...@0016@0003
But then can we call
it quits?@0003
You've let me win enough, and
I don't want to bleed you dry.@0003@000CNo. I won't let you leave, not
while you're still ahead.@0003
Hurry up. We don't have the
luxury of time here.@0003@0009What's that saying? The cooler
the head, the hotter he bets?@0003
Something like that. And you seem
pretty cool most of the time.@0003
@0017I guess the old saying is true.@0003@0017
# 0x0CF7
@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@010F@000CThanks for waiting.
Let's get started.@0003@0009You can't be serious.
You want to keep going?@0003@000CJust flip the coin.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Oh, brother.@0003
@0017Your Highness, I have a little
admission to make here.@0003
You have no chance of winning.
The whole thing is rigged.@0003@000CRigged@0016...@0016@0003@0009Yeah. You flip the coin
@0016...@0016like this.@0003
Then catch it in the hand.@0003
I'm the one holding the coin.@0003
I can turn it over any way I choose
just by moving my palm a bit.@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Like this.@0003@0017@000CHmm@0016... @0016That's how you did it@0016...@0016@0003
I knew you were up to something.@0003
It was straining my disbelief that
you could keep winning like that.@0003
Strange that I couldn't catch
on to your little trick, though.@0003@0009@0017That's nice of you to say, but
I'm sure you must have suspected.@0003
There's a guy who hangs out near
a pub in Jehanna. He's real smooth.@0003
His secret is to mix in just enough
losses to make it look plausible.@0003
If you ever go there, you'll know
the guy I'm talking about right away.@0003@0017@000CInteresting. I've never had any
experience with this sort of thing.@0003
One only has so much time when he's
groomed to become the king, you know.@0003@0009@0017I can imagine.@0003
But a king must have a wide range
of knowledge, don't you think?@0003
When I was a journeyman, I lost
a lot of money to scams like this.@0003
I started learning these tricks so
they couldn't be used on me anymore!@0003
It's all rubbish, innit? But it's not
a bad thing to add to your experience.@0003@0017@000CI must hand it to you, you
have a point.@0003
Some things, you can only
learn firsthand, on the field.@0003@0009@0017Well, I've given away enough
of my secrets for one day.@0003
I'll give you back all the money
I took you for, so go easy on me@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CWait.@0003@0009Hm?@0003@000CThere's no need to give it back.@0003
That I failed to see your trick
was my own failing.@0003@0009@0017You serious?@0003
All right. Good deal.
You're a good man.@0003
Let's just call this
your tuition fee, eh?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Wait.@0003@0009Now what? What is it this time?@0003@000CWe're still in the middle of the bet.@0003
We'll pick up where we left off.@0003@0009Are you saying@0016...@0016
you want to keep going?@0003@000C@0017Naturally.@0003
You've revealed your secrets to
me. My luck is bound to change.@0003
I feel a winning streak coming on.@0003@0017@0017@0009@0016...@0016Oh, brother.@0003
Well, you're persistent,
I'll give you that much.@0003
Call it in the air.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Tails.@0003
# 0x0CF8
@0009@0010@012A@0009So, is today my lucky day? Or@0016...@0016@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009@0006@0002Tails, hm?@0005@0003
@0017Oh, well. Luck's just not on
my side today, I guess.@0003@0017@0006@000C@0010@0122@000COh, may I ask what you are doing?@0003@0009@0017Hm? Oh, I was just checking my luck.@0003
Looks like today is not set to be
one of my better ones.@0003@0017@000CThat's not good!@0003
Perhaps if you gave up that coin
for some good, honest prayer@0016...@0016@0003
I have no need of luck, you see,
for I benefit from divine grace!@0003@0009@0017That sounds nice. I'd love to
have a bit of that myself.@0003
All right, let's have a quick
bet to see which is better.@0003
We'll test your divine grace
against my good old luck.@0003@0017@000COh, I could never give in to such
a vile sin.@0003
Gambling is a pox, a boil upon
the fair skin of mankind.@0003@0009@0017That's going a bit far,
don't you think?@0003@0017@000CGambling corrupts the masses,
and I'll have none of it.@0003
Which is the more noble: to earn
your keep or to swindle it?@0003
And besides, this is a battlefield,
not a gambling hall.@0003
No, I simply will not indulge in
such spiritual pollution here.@0003@0009@0017Oh, you're really making too
much of a big deal out of it.@0003
This is just a coin toss. You can
flip a coin just about anywhere.@0003
@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Let's see@0016...@0016@0003@0002
Well, heads or tails?
What is it?@0003@0017@000CSince you refuse to resist
the evils of temptation@0016...@0016@0003
I shall have to teach you a
lesson you won't soon forget.@0003
Heads!@0003@0009@0017I knew you'd come around!
Right, so let's see here@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Hey! It's heads!
You really are lucky!@0003@000CHuh? I won?@0003
@0017Well, of course I won! I shouldn't
be so surprised. It was fate.@0003
One as blessed as I could never lose
at something so base as gambling.@0003@0017@0017@0009Great, so let's keep going.@0003
How about putting some money
down this time? 100 gold coins?@0003@000CThat's fine.@0003
Anything I win will, of course,
fund only noble causes.@0003@0009That's my girl@0016...@0016@0003

tails, what's your call?@0003@000CHeads. What else?@0003

I wanted to win back my money.@0003
You were doing pretty well the
other day. I was overconfident.@0003
But today, I'm feeling lucky.@0003@0017@0017@000CI accept your proposal.@0003
But remember, I think that gambling
is an immoral, inexcusable pastime.@0003
You can tell it is wicked, because
of how good you feel when you win.@0003@0009Can't disagree with you there.@0003
Last time, I went easy on you
because you were an amateur.@0003
Don't think I'm gonna throw
away my money like that today.@0003@000CI would never ask you to go easy
on me, Joshua.@0003
After all, I have righteousness at
my side, and I need no favors.@0003@0009@0017Righteousness? Is that
what you've got?@0003
@0017And to think, you were the one
telling me gambling was wrong!@0003@000COh, but it is wrong. I meant to teach you
a lesson, and your lesson continues.@0003
When done for a just cause, surely
gambling could not possibly be wrong.@0003

You're slowing down the game!@0003@0009Hold on, give me a break!@0003
You got me. I lost.

Where's your spirit?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Man. I just don't get it.
Not at all.@0003
You must really have some sort of
divine powers on your side.@0003

single game, and I still can't wi--@0003@000CFixing? What do you mean? The

@0017Anyway, I'm all done. I don't
want to play with you anymore.@0003

are you talking about?@0003@0009Look, what I'm trying to say is@0016...@0016@0003
You don't know anything, and you
STILL managed to beat me!@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CWhat do you mean, I don't know
anything? Oh! Such disrespect!@0003
What do you know, other than
gambling? Tell me that!@0003@0009Hm? Let's see@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I know how to survive in
a desert, for one thing.@0003@0017@000CI think we're all quite familiar

If that's all you've got, don't go
around telling me I'M the ignorant one!@0003@0009Aaaah! Enough already! Fine! Fine!
I was wrong!!!@0003
Anyway, the point is that I'm not
gambling with you ANYMORE!@0003@0009@0011@0006@000COh! He ran away!

way, you ever hear this?@0003@0017@0009Hear what?@0003@000C@0017Well, I guess it was popular for
a while, way back when.@0003
But when two swordsmen met on the
battlefield--even allied swordsmen--@0003
they would duel it out to test one
another's worth with the blade.@0003
So what do you say? Don't you think
it's time to revive this tradition?@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0005
You want me to kill you?@0003@000CNo, no, no. I'm not saying we have

make this more interesting?@0003

hurry? Let's do this another day.@0003

anticipation a little bit.@0003@0017@0009I don't get it,
but fine.@0003@000C@0017Great! We're all set then.@0003
Next time we meet, we
cross swords. Deal?@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0003
There's nothing to anticipate.

There!!@0003@0015@0008@0080@000B@000A@0080@000D@000BHa!
@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0011@000B@0011@0007@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@011E@0009Whew@0016...@0016 After a match like that,
@0017I can be happy with a tie!@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0017You're better than I thought.@0003@0017@000CYou're not too bad yourself.@0003@0009@0017Heh@0016... @0016Thanks.@0003
But remember, I was at a slight
disadvantage, so@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CI must admit, I did hold you at
a slight disadvantage.@0003
However, we are closely matched,
despite our incompatible styles.@0003
I simply couldn't land a decisive
blow. But it was all worthwhile.@0003
After all, I've learned, and that
is worth far more than any wager.@0003@0009@0017I see.
@0017You're a quick one, aren't you?@0003
How did you get that good?@0003@000CFighting is all I have.@0003@0009You live for the sword, eh?@0003
@0017I prefer rolling the dice to
swinging the sword, you know?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Why is that?@0003@0009@0017Whew@0016...@0016@0005@0003
I thought you'd never ask.@0003
@0017You're asking how I got hooked
on gambling, right?@0003
Let me see@0016...@0016 There's not
much to tell.@0003
I guess by the time I realized it,
@0017it was already too late.@0003
I'd grown bored of everything
before I discovered gambling.@0003
But then I saw it--gambling was
like life, in short little bursts.@0003
Life itself is just one big gamble!
@0017That's how I see things.@0003@000CI see.
@0016...@0016@0003
I don't know anything about
gambling, but it was a good duel.@0003
We must try this again soon.@0003@0009What, with no wager? That
doesn't sound very fun.@0003@000CSuit yourself.@0003@0009@0017You mean that? Then we'll
have another bet.@0003
I'll win next time.
See you later.@0003@0017@000CSee you.@0003

How's this?@0003@001D@000F@0080@000F@000DOof@0016...@0016@0003@000A@0011@000D@0011@0007@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@011E@0009@0017Whew@0016...@0016
Looks like I won this time.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0005
I made a mistake.@0003@0009@0017No, you're just having a bad day.@0003
And it's not like I had a
decisive victory this time.@0003
I'd say we're still just
about even.@0003@0017@000CAll that matters is that
I didn't win.@0003
You won the bet. What
do you want me to do?@0003@0009@0017Oh, you remembered our last bet!
That makes me happy.@0003
All right, here goes@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009I want you to be my partner
for a while@0016...@0016@0003
@0017How's that sound?@0003@0017@000CWhat?@0004
Your partner?@0003@0009@0017Don't get the wrong idea. I just meant
for training. And gambling.@0003@0017@000CSo, nothing would change@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Well, I suppose, but there's still
a point to it all.@0003@0017@000CWhat's that?@0003@0009@0017If I train with you, I'm going
to become a better swordsman.@0003
And if we train together, maybe
we'll each learn something.@0003@0017@000CI could ask nothing better.@0003@0009@0017And there's something that I want to
do soon when the war is over.@0003
It's something that can't be done
in a single day or overnight.@0003
You could probably call this the
biggest gamble of my entire life.@0003
I'm going to have to hone my skills,
and I'll need someone to help me.@0003
@0017What do you say, Marisa?
Won't you lend me a hand?@0003@000CI'm good for fighting, and
not much else.@0003@0009@0017You think? I doubt that's true.@0003
Well, think about it.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016I'll do it.@0003@0009I know this is a gamble, but@0016...@0016
@0017gambling is my hobby.@0003@0017@000CI see that.@0003@0009@0017Well, don't let me down.@0003@0017@000CI won't. But try to keep it
interesting, all right?@0003@0009@0017Heh. Then I'll do my best to
keep you entertained.@0003
And remember what I said@0016...@0016
Life is a gamble.@0003
You never know what'll happen.@0003
But don't worry. I'm sure you
won't be bored.@0003
Besides, how often do you meet
someone you can spar with?@0003
@0017Not to mention someone who
can actually beat you!@0003@000CI'll win next time, though.@0003@0009@0017That's the spirit, Marisa.@0003@0017
# 0x0CFE
@0017@0009@0010@011B@000C@0010@012A@000CYou're Gerik, right? Head
of that band of mercenaries?@0003@0009@0017Where's your respect? I've got
a title. Use it.@0003@0017@000COh@0016...@0016 My mistake. Pardon me.
I'm Joshua.@0003
I heard you once commanded a band
of over a hundred mercenaries.@0003
I've been wanting to talk to you.@0003@0009Huh. So that's what you've heard, is
it? You look a bit on the rough side.@0003
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're
no ordinary swordsman, are you?@0003@000C@0016...@0016It's just like they said.@0003
You're a natural leader. Commanding and
observant--it's a rare combination.@0003@0009Ah, thanks. So what brings you
over here, anyway?@0003
Didn't just come here to say
hello, did you?@0003@000CYou ARE a sharp one.@0003@0009Not half as sharp as your sword,
from what I've seen out there.@0003@000CActually, I'm here with an offer,
but I didn't want to rush into it.@0003
I'd hate to mess this one up.@0003
I can't go into the details just
now, but it's a big job.@0003
I'm guessing it'll pay pretty
well, too.@0003@0009I see.@0003
Well, you have me curious. I'm looking
forward to hearing your offer.@0003@000CYou should be.@0003
# 0x0CFF
@0017@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@011B@0009Hey, Gerik.@0003@000C@0017Is that you, Joshua?
@0017So, I hear you like to gamble.@0003@0009You hear right. Care to
try your luck?@0003@000CHa ha ha. I'll pass.@0003
But tell me, why do you
like gambling so much?@0003@0009I've got my reasons. Mostly, I just
like to believe in my own luck.@0003@000C@0017Luck?@0003@0017@0009Oh, yeah@0016...@0016@0003
See, you can have all the skill in
the world and still have a bad day.@0003
It doesn't take much for the most
fortunate man around to have a fall.@0003
A royal family at the height of their
power gets betrayed, and that's the end.@0003
It's life really, innit?@0003@000CHmm@0016...@0016
You've got a point there.@0003
@0017But you know, Joshua, you don't
want to use luck as an excuse.@0003
Don't blame luck if you lose a
fight. Blame yourself, but not luck.@0003
Renais didn't fall because of bad
fortune. It was malice that did it.@0003
You're right--there's good luck and
bad, but it's no excuse for failure.@0003@0017@0009@0017Well, that's a good point
you've got there.@0003
@0017But I think I'll just keep
believing in my luck for now.@0003@000CWhatever works for you.@0003
If you're an even match against
someone, sure, luck is a factor.@0003
But you're not counting on luck
alone, are you?@0003
You're a fine swordsman, and that
isn't all luck's doing there.@0003@0009You are far too observant.
We're lucky you're on our side.@0003@000CThat's the best compliment
a mercenary can get.@0003@0009Call it a hunch, but I think this is
the start of a long friendship.@0003@000CYou think so, huh?@0003
I wonder if that's just
a lucky guess.@0003@0009Well, I'm a lucky guy.@0003
# 0x0D00
@0017@0009@0010@012A@000C@0010@011B@000CHey, Joshua, I don't mind a little
friendly gambling with my men,@0003
but would you mind not fleecing
them too much? It's demoralizing.@0003@0009@0017Hm?@0005
@0017Oh, you're talking about those guys?@0003
Man! They wore me out! They just kept
losing and losing and losing,@0003
and they still wouldn't give up!@0003
If they'll risk so much on a bet, they
might risk too much in a battle.@0003
You're their commander. You should
have a word with them.@0003@000CHa ha ha@0016... @0016Good point. I'll talk to
the boys. But, Joshua@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I'm going to have to win back the
money that you took from my men.@0003@0017@0009It's about time! I've been waiting
for you to put the challenge to me.@0003@000COh, I'll do more than
just challenge you.@0003@0009So if you win, I'll cough up
your men's money.@0003
And if I win@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat's it going to be?
Come on, out with it.@0003@0009@0017I want you to join me when
this war is over.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016That's all you want?@0003
Well, it doesn't sound like your
standard mercenary assignment,@0003
but you've piqued my interest.
This sounds like a big bet.@0003
I'm not sure I get what you're
after in all this, but@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Fine. You've got a bet.@0003@0017@0009Great, then let's go@0016...@0016
How 'bout we flip a coin?@0003@000CThat's it? I'm wagering my
life on a coin toss?@0003
Eh, why not? Flip it.@0003@0009Heads or tails?
What's your call?@0003@000C@0016...@0016Heads.@0003@0009Which leaves me with tails.
@0016...@0016Here it goes@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Hup!@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0016...@0016Ready to see what it is?@0003
@0016...@0016
@0017Look! It's tails!@0003@0017@0017@000CI won. Now, let me have
the men's money back.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Wait, you called heads@0016...@0016@0003@000CI sure did. But you cheated.
Open your left hand.@0003
There--you palmed the coin
and swapped in a fake one.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016@0003@0002
You ARE observant. Not a lot of people can
see through that. You're right. You win.@0003
Here, I'll give you back the money.@0003@0017@000CHa ha ha. Thanks, Joshua. I'll
get this back to the men.@0003@0009@0017Mind if I ask how you
found me out?@0003
I like to think I've gotten
pretty good at that trick.@0003@0017@000CBefore I became a mercenary, gambling
was my one true love in life.@0003
I've had to learn how to see through
a LOT of tricks in my day.@0003@0009@0017So, wait@0016...@0016 You just pretended
not to be interested in gambling?@0003
@0017You're really something. You pulled
a fast one on me. Today's not my--@0003@000CNot your lucky day? Don't say that, Joshua.
You were just out of your league is all.@0003@0009I'm starting to think maybe I was.
But then again, maybe not@0016...@0016@0003
Maybe today was just YOUR lucky day.@0003@000CHa ha ha@0016...@0016
I like your enthusiasm.@0003
And I'm glad you appreciate
my gambling prowess.@0003@0009I haven't given up on you yet.@0003
When this war is over, let's
have us a quick duel.@0003
If I win, you come work for me.@0003@000CYou're on. Just make sure
you stay alive until then.@0003@0009Don't worry. I'm feeling lucky.@0003

@0017Oh, Kyle! How have you been?@0003@0017@000CWhat are you doing out here?
Are you--@0006 Are you painting?@0003@0009@0017No! I-- Well, yes. Actually, I'm
not so much painting as sketching.@0003
I use this piece of charcoal to
draw and shade, like this.@0003@0017@000CYou know we're in the middle
of a battle, don't you?@0003
What if someone attacks while
you're distracted?@0003@0009Calm down, calm down.@0003
I just like to keep a record of
our battles with these pictures.@0003@000CYou're just rationalizing!@0003
You're a cavalier--it's time
to start acting like one.@0003@0009@0017Fine, fine. I'll stop.@0003
As you command, Sir Kyle, commander
of the Knights of Renais.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Oh, brother. Do you have to
make everything so difficult?@0003@0009@0017If you don't want the hassle,
stop telling me what to do!@0003@0017@000CThen stop fooling around on the
battlefield.@0003
Seriously, wasting my time on an
idiot like you is just stupid.@0003@0009Huh?@0005
Did you say something?@0003@000CNothing!@0003
If you have so much time to waste
drawing, let's have a quick spar.@0003@0009What! You want to spar? Now?@0003@000CYeah, that's right. I don't waste time.@0003
I take care of my weapons, my horse,
and myself.@0003
And not just that--I also make sure our
morale is good and our men are safe.@0003@0009You're thorough, aren't you?@0003@000CI'm a knight. It's my duty.@0003@0009@0017You really need to take
yourself less seriously.@0003@0017@000CAnd you need to take your
duty MORE seriously.@0003

@0017Oh, why am I so sleepy?@0003@0017@0009@0010@0118@0009Forde! Are you falling asleep
on the battlefield!?@0003
What is wrong with you, man!?@0003@000C@0080@001C@000C@0017What are you so fired up about?
You're really ruining my nap.@0003@0017@0009You have no sense of self-preservation,
do you? What is wrong with you?@0003
You lack even the common sense of
an infant, you know that?@0003@000C@0017Oh, you're one to talk.@0003
When you were a baby, you were planning
out strategies to take over the nursery.@0003
You were stuck up then, and you're stuck
up now. And STILL the ladies liked you!@0003@0017@0009You leave them out of this!
Women have nothing to do with it.@0003@000CThey don't? Oh, come on!@0003
Isn't it important to have an heir to
carry your standard when you're gone?@0003
Take your sister, Mia--she married
into a nice Frelian family, didn't she?@0003
I'm just curious who would ever settle
for such an uptight knight as you.@0003
You ever think about that? You think
you might meet her in this war?@0003@0009That's not what I'm here for!@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha ha. Of course not. But I
bet you're still a ladies' man, huh?@0003
I know you--you're a perfect gentlemen,
always nice to the ladies.@0003
I remember when you were little, you
were always the first to help when@0003
you saw a little girl crying. You
would go running up to lend a hand.@0003
I still remember how impressed I was
that you would do that. It was cool.@0003@0017@0009I just could never turn my back
on someone in need.@0003
It is what's expected of a knight.@0003@000C@0017Yeah, but you weren't a knight yet!@0003@0017@0009Well, it's@0016...@0016expected of someone
who aspires to be a knight, too!@0003@000C@0017You've got an answer for everything!@0003
But, I have to admit, you've also
got my respect. You're a good guy.@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000C@0017Wow! Now you're embarrassed.@0003@0017@0009Forde!@0003

one who looks tired this time.@0003@0017@000COh, Forde. It's you. I was just
lost in thought for a moment.@0003
I figured that I could use a
little breathing room.@0003
I guess that's why you paint
your landscapes, isn't it?@0003@0009@0017That's right. You see it now?@0003
Everyone needs a little space to
think, even on the battlefield.@0003@0017@000CWell, I wouldn't go so far as to
approve of painting during a battle.@0003
What if the younger soldiers started
to copy your example?@0003
However, I see your point. Everyone
needs a way to clear one's head.@0003
So@0016...@0016 How long have you been
doing those drawings, anyway?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWhat's the matter? Forgotten
when you started?@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
I started drawing and painting
when my mother died.@0003@000CReally?@0003@0009When I was young, I won a tournament
for training swordsmen@0016...@0016@0003@000CI remember that.
I took second place.@0003@0009She seemed far more pleased at a picture
I'd drawn of her than at my victory.@0003
She kept that picture near her always,
and she looked at it often.@0003
She rejoiced more in my skill with the
brush than in my skill with the sword.@0003
I never understood why@0016...@0016 Not until
recently, at any rate.@0003@000CYour mother was very kind.
I remember that about her.@0003
I'm sorry that she fell ill
while you were so young.@0003@0009I feel lucky--I have my memories
of her, after all.@0003
Franz, though@0016...@0016 He was too little
to talk or even walk.@0003
That's why I kept that picture of
her hanging in our home.@0003@000CSo that's the story behind that
picture in your house@0016...@0016@0003
I didn't realize you drew it.@0003
I remember watching you practice
swordplay when we were little.@0003
I wanted to be like you, and I was
irritated that I didn't practice more.@0003
I got so upset with myself when I lost
the tournament to you.@0003
That's why I work so hard to keep
practicing and improving my skills.@0003@0009@0016...@0016I didn't know@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0017Oh, man. It's not like me to get
this introspective.@0003
What is it about you that makes me
talk so much?@0003
Come on, let's go.@0003@0017@0017@000CHeh. All right.@0003
Oh, and, Forde@0016...@0016@0003@0009What?@0003@000CWhen this whole war is over,
teach me how to paint.@0003@0009Yeah, all right. Fine. But we both
have to get out of here alive first.@0003@000CIt's a deal.@0003

@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0118@000CYou're Selena, aren't you? Commander
of Frelia's pegasus knights?@0003@0009I am.@0003
And I know who you are. You are
Sir Kyle, cavalier of Renais.@0003@000CI'm honored that you know my name.
I don't believe we've met, have we?@0003@0009We met once, about ten years ago
or so. You may have forgotten.@0003@000CTen years ago@0016...@0016@0005 Wait,
you're@0016...@0016THAT Syrene!?@0003@0009@0017So, you've finally remembered me?@0003@0017@0017@000CDo I ever! I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.@0003@0009Well, Sir Kyle, you certainly
have turned out well.@0003@000COh, please. Let's do away with
the honorifics, shall we?@0003@0009Of course, Kyle. Ah, you haven't
changed at all. It takes me back.@0003@000CI barely recognized you, Syrene.
You look completely changed.@0003
I had no idea you'd become a
knight--a pegasus knight, no less!@0003@0009That's nice of you to say.
So I've grown, have I?@0003@000CYou've grown a lot. It's a shame we
have to be reunited on a battlefield.@0003@0009You're right about that. We ought
to sit down and talk soon.@0003@000CI'd like that, too, Syrene. But let's
finish off this lot first, shall we?@0003@0009All right, but don't try to be a
hero like last time, all right?@0003@000C@0017A hero? What did I do?@0003@0017@0009Well, that's your homework.
See if you can't remember.@0003
# 0x0D05
@0009@0010@0118@000C@0010@012B@000C@0017How are you holding up, Kyle?@0003@0017@0009The war is tough, but my sword
arm is strong, and I am well.@0003@000CMmm. That's an awfully stuffy response.@0003@0009Stuffy? It's accurate.
Isn't that enough?@0003
But that's beside the point. I still can't
figure out what you were talking about.@0003@000COh, your homework? You've been thinking
about it all this time? You're so serious!@0003
@0017I was right. You haven't changed in the
slightest. You've always been this way.@0003
Remember when I tried to show you around
Frelia's castle town?@0003
You said, I'm here to do my duty. Not to
sightsee, and you went back inside.@0003
You went home without even trying
Frelia's fabulous seafood!@0003
King Hayden thought I'd been remiss
in showing you our fair city.@0003@0017@0009I'm sorry about that, Syrene.
I had no idea@0016...@0016@0003
I was on a special mission to
deliver a letter to King Hayden.@0003
I didn't have any time for
sightseeing, like I'd said.@0003@000C@0017Are you seriously apologizing
for that? It was so long ago!@0003@0017@0017@0009Ha ha ha@0016...@0016 You're right,
you're right.@0003
@0016...@0016I know I was only there for three
days, but that was a memorable trip.@0003
I grew up in landlocked Renais. I'd
never seen the ocean.@0003
Not before you showed it to me.@0003@000CYou didn't show any interest at
all in local culture or cuisine.@0003
But when I asked if you'd like to
go to the sea, you got so excited!@0003@0009It was intense. I felt so small,
standing there, staring at the sea.@0003
Looking over the waves, I hoped that I
could be that strong, that persistent.@0003@000CI think that's the only time
I've ever seen the real you.@0003
I know we only spent a half day
together, but it was such fun.@0003@0009@0017Really?
@0017I'm glad to hear that.@0003@000CMaybe sometime, we can
do that again.@0003@0009I'd like that. Let's use that
hope to drive us on.@0003
When we've restored peace, we'll
go see the Frelian coast again.@0003@000CYes, definitely.@0003
# 0x0D06
@0009@0010@012B@000C@0010@0118@000CWhat's wrong, Syrene?
Are you hurt?@0003@0009No, I'm fine, but I'm worried
about my pegasus@0016...@0016@0003@000CHere, let me take a look.@0003
Hm. Looks like he's got a wound here
that hasn't properly healed.@0003
@0017I can fix this up for you.@0003
It's nothing serious, but you might want
to get him some proper care later.@0003@0017@0017@0009Thanks, Kyle. You're a lifesaver.@0003
@0017It was careless of me not to
have noticed the injury.@0003@0017@000CYour pegasus is smart. He may have hidden
it from you so as not to worry you.@0003
It's not your fault, Syrene. You
shouldn't worry about it.@0003@0009@0017No, I'm just not fit to be a pegasus
knight. I'm so pitiful.@0003
If you hadn't seen that injury, I could
have put us both in danger.@0003
I could have cost us both our lives.@0003@0017@000CYou're being too hard on yourself.@0003
If you were in danger, I would have
been at your side in an instant.@0003
I'm sure you would do the same,
wouldn't you?@0003@0009@0016...@0016Yes, gladly.@0003@000CWe just have to help one another
out if something happens.@0003
You and I have been friends for
over ten years, after all.@0003@0009@0017For over ten years?@0003@0017@000CThat's right, Syrene. You did
the same for me back then.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016Back then?@0003@0017@000CIt was on the day I left Frelia.@0003
Near the border, I came upon some
bandits harassing a poor merchant.@0003
I tried to help him, but I was
outnumbered. Badly.@0003
When they saw I was a knight, they
wasted no time surrounding me.@0003
I thought that was it for me, but
then, out of nowhere, you show up.@0003
You and I drove off those bandits,
and you saved my life that day.@0003@0009@0017I see you've finished your homework.@0003@0017@000COh, so that's what you wanted me to
remember! Don't be a hero indeed!@0003@0009You'd left Frelia before I could give
you a going-away present.@0003
I went out, hoping to catch up to you,
when I saw you surrounded by bandits.@0003
You were fighting all those bandits
on your own to save that merchant@0016...@0016@0003
I'd never seen a knight so dedicated
to the protection of the innocent.@0003@000CGoing-away present@0016...@0016 You're
talking about this, aren't you?@0003@0009@0017The wooden pegasus I carved for you!
@0017@0016...@0016You still have it?@0003@000COf course I do! After we dealt with
those bandits, you said to me,@0003
Keep this, and remember Frelia.@0003
How could I possibly misplace it?
I carry it with me as a reminder.@0003
As long as I have this, I feel like I'll
always have someone watching over me.@0003
Actually, I started collecting wooden
figurines since you gave me this.@0003
But I always carry this one on me.@0003@0009I'm glad to hear it's
meant so much to you.@0003@000CI'll treasure it always.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0005
@0016...@0016Kyle@0016...@0016@0003
When we're all at peace again,
won't you visit Frelia once more?@0003@000CYou know@0016...@0016@0005
I was thinking about that, too.@0003
I think I really missed out by
not having Frelian seafood.@0003
This time around, I won't miss it.
And I should see some sights, too.@0003
Will you show me around, Syrene?@0003@0009Yes, I'd love to. I've been told
I can fry up a mean fish, too!@0003

whole court in an uproar, you know?@0003
Running off to fight with this
troop without a word to your father?@0003@0017@0009I'm sorry for all the trouble
I've caused, but I'm fine.@0003@000CI was ordered to watch over you
and ensure your safe return.@0003
I intend to stay by your side and
serve as your bodyguard, Princess.@0003@0009I'm happy to have you at my
side, Syrene.@0003
Honestly, I was starting to
get a little fed up.@0003@000C@0017Why is that, Princess?@0003@0017@0009@0017I saw that letter my father had
sent. Defend Tana to the death!?@0003
Is he serious? The soldiers think
so--they won't leave me alone!@0003
I appreciate the concern, but
I'd like a LITTLE privacy!@0003@0017@000CHa ha ha@0016...@0016@0005
That does sound like King Hayden.@0003
He looked so sad when you left.
It was more than I could bear.@0003@0009@0017@0016...@0016I know. I feel bad@0016...@0016
@0017Hey, Syrene.@0003
Doesn't this remind you of when
we were children?@0003
When we were together, it was like
I finally had an older sister.@0003@000CThat was my first assignment after
graduating from the academy.@0003
I'd been asked to watch over you.
It was a huge job for a young knight.@0003
But I enjoyed my work. You were
always so kind. I miss those days.@0003@0009@0017I was so lonely when you got
promoted to the pegasus knights.@0003
@0017But now, I'm glad to see you've
risen so high.@0003
It means that, even out here in the
battlefield, we can spend time together.@0003
I want to talk about the old days,
about Frelia and my father.@0003@000CYes, let's.@0003
Shall we go now?@0003@0009All right, but don't
forget about tonight!@0003
# 0x0D08
@0017@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@012B@0009Hello, Syrene!@0003
I'm so glad we talked the other
night. I had so much fun.@0003@000CI did, too, my lady. I was
quite surprised, in fact.@0003
The young Princess Tana I once
knew has grown so much.@0003@0009@0017Y-you think so? Tell me,
how have I changed?@0003@0017@000CYou're so serious now. This war
has made you serious.@0003
You're not the same princess
I remember from my youth.@0003@0009@0017I know that I've lived a sheltered
life being the princess.@0003
I know that I've taken my family's
wealth for granted.@0003
When I saw what the war had done to
the people of Renais and Frelia,@0003
I knew that I needed to do something
to change things.@0003
@0017And you know what? You taught me
something I never forgot.@0003@000C@0017@0016...@0016I did?@0003@0017@0009Yes, that's right.@0003
Your strength and pride
as a pegasus knight.@0003
Your graciousness and
kindness as a human being.@0003
Your example is a lesson that
has stuck with me, Syrene.@0003@000CI'm honored to hear that I've
had such an impact on you.@0003
You truly are a kind lady.@0003
Serving the Frelian royal house
has been my greatest joy.@0003@0009There's@0016...@0016another lesson I was
hoping you could teach me.@0003@000CIf I can help, I would be glad to.@0003@0009I'd like you to teach me@0016...@0016cooking.@0003@000C@0017I can make some traditional Frelian
dishes, but I'm no gourmet chef@0016...@0016@0003
@0017But if you don't mind, then I'd be
happy to teach you what I know.@0003@0009Thank you! When I return home to
Frelia after this war is over,@0003
I hope to cook my parents a proper
meal to apologize for running off.@0003@000CI'm sure they'll be surprised to see
how much you've grown out here.@0003
Surprised and pleased. They'll certainly
forgive you for going off on your own.@0003@0009@0017Sometimes, I wonder@0016...@0016 I do
hope that they forgive me.@0003@0017@000COf course they will. They're angry
because they're concerned.@0003
If you return safely, they will
be relieved, not upset.@0003@0009@0017You're right@0016...@0016
@0017Thank you, Syrene.@0003
But it can't hurt to ease their
anger with some good food!@0003@000CRight you are, milady. I'll teach
you everything I know about food.@0003
# 0x0D09
@0017@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@012B@000CThat food you made the other night was
fabulous. The soldiers told me about it.@0003@0009@0017Really? @0017They were talking about
my food? I was so nervous.@0003@000CYou've learned the basics well. That's
a solid foundation for all Frelian food.@0003
Take care of yourself, milady.@0003
I look forward to hearing how your
parents respond to your cooking.@0003@0009You take care of yourself, too, Syrene.
It's your duty to protect me, right?@0003
Then I want you to fulfill your duty
and promise to go home with me!@0003@000CI shall do what I can.@0003
@0017But the battlefield can be a
dangerous place, milady.@0003
If something happens to me, see to
it that you return home safely.@0003@0017@0017@0009Syrene@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000C@000AYou're like a real sister to me.
I've always admired you.@0003
You've taught me so much already,@0003
and there's so much more that I
can learn from you@0016...@0016@0003
@000A@0080@000C@000ASo you can't die. You have to come
back home to Frelia with me.@0003
No matter what.@0003@000CPrincess Tana@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0080@000D@000BI shall never leave your side, milady.@0004
But if something should happen to me@0016...@0016@0003
If, perchance, I were to@0016...@0016to die,
I would die happy knowing you were safe.@0003
@0017Please, don't waste my sacrifice.
Make it home, safe, alive, and well.@0003@0017@000A@0017I will. I promise.
@0017But you have to promise me@0016...@0016@0003
Promise that you will do everything
in your power to return home with me.@0003@000B@0017I will, Princess Tana. We will
return to Frelia together. I promise.@0003@0017
# 0x0D0A
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0113@0009@0017Hello, Sir Cormag.@0003@0017@000CPrincess Tana!@0003
That still sounds so odd to me. You know,
I had no idea you were a princess at first.@0003
But please, just call me Cormag. There's
no need for honorifics with me.@0003@0009@0017Cormag it is, then. I had
a favor to ask of you.@0003@0017@000CWhat would you have me do, Princess?@0003@0009I'm prone to attacks from archers
when I'm on the battlefield@0016...@0016@0003@000CThat makes two of us.@0003
It's a common problem for
airborne soldiers.@0003@0009@0017I thought perhaps we could keep watch
for archers and warn one another.@0003@0017@000CHm. Yes, you've got a good idea
there. A buddy system of sorts.@0003
But if you saw an ally in danger, you'd
warn him regardless, wouldn't you?@0003@0009Well, of course! But we're so high
up that I was worried@0016...@0016@0003
If I saw an archer, I didn't think
my voice would carry to you in time.@0003
@0017Perhaps the neighing of a pegasus or
the cries of a wyvern could carry@0003
far enough to warn the others.@0003@0017@000COh! I see@0016...@0016 Yes, we might not be able
to hear each other in the heat of battle.@0003
But our steeds can be louder than
either of us could.@0003
@0017And trust me, my wyvern's shriek can
pierce your ear from two leagues away.@0003
@0017A brilliant idea, Your Highness.@0003@0017@0009Really?
Thank you.@0003@000CRight, so if we see anything out there,
we'll have our mounts call out, right?@0003@0009Yes, and thank you, Cormag.@0003
# 0x0D0B
@0017@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@0113@0009Cormag, thanks for warning me about
that archer the other day.@0003
Your wyvern startled me, but I think
you may have saved my life!@0003@000CWell, you should thank him, then.
I can't take credit for it.@0003
I mean, he started shrieking out to
you before I even saw that bowman.@0003@0009@0017Really?@0004
That's amazing@0016...@0016@0003
@0017In that case@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0005@0009@0080@000C@000A@0017@0005Thank you.@0003@0017@0017@000CThe bond between a wyvern and rider
is close, and this guy's a smart one.@0003
I'm sure you and your pegasus
are the same, wouldn't you say?@0003@000AOh, yes. It's the same with every
knight and her pegasus.@0003
It's so sad to see how war has changed
the way we relate to our animal allies.@0003
It's taking such a tremendous toll
on these beautiful creatures.@0003@000CI agree. This whole war is ludicrous.@0003
War itself is madness, even more so if
it's for greed or the fantasy of power.@0003@000AI hope our efforts end this war quickly.
I don't want to see anyone else die.@0003@000CNor do I. But you cannot race
headlong into battle.@0003
We'll need you to help rebuild
our shattered nations, after all.@0003
We soldiers are expendable, but
you regal types aren't.@0003@000A@0080@000C@000ACormag, don't say that!@0003@000CBut it's true.@0003@000ANo! No life is expendable!@0003@000CYour Highness@0016...@0016@0003@000ADon't throw your life away.
@0017Promise me, will you?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003
As you wish, Princess.
I'll be careful.@0003@000A@0017I have your promise, Cormag.@0003@0017

man who's lost his faith?@0003
A man whose emperor has gone mad,
whose homeland is collapsing?@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
What are you going to do
when the war is over?@0003@000CI'll help rebuild Grado, of course,
but I'm not sure beyond that.@0003
I doubt that I'll remain in Grado
for long, though.@0003
They've branded me a traitor. I'll
find no home awaiting me there.@0003@0009@0017Then why don't you come to Frelia?
You can join us as an airborne knight!@0003@0017@000CAnd what makes you think a traitor
like me would be welcomed in Frelia?@0003@0009@0017You're no traitor, Cormag. You've
stayed true to your beliefs.@0003
@0017That sadness I saw in you comes from your
own country's betrayal of those beliefs.@0003
Your sadness runs as deep as your
faith in Grado once ran.@0003
@0017I want your faith, your strength, and
your passion to serve Frelia now.@0003@0017@000CI appreciate the offer, but I cannot
reforge the oaths I've broken.@0003
@0017I'm sorry.@0003@0017@0009It's all right.@0005
I understand your feelings.@0003
@0017However, if you ever wish to serve
your beliefs again, remember my offer.@0003@0017@000C@0017I might just give up this soldiering
nonsense and go into woodworking.@0003@0017@0017@0009Then I'll track you down in
your woodshop and ask again.@0003@000CYou may not look it, but you're
pretty strong willed for a princess.@0003
I'll think about your offer.@0003

Everyone back home is worried.@0003
Don't you worry, though. I'll
protect you from now on.@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003
Tana, what are you doing here? You
have no place on the battlefield.@0003
I want you to return to Castle
Frelia immediately.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Why does everyone say that!?@0003
I am one of Frelia's pegasus
knights and a trained soldier!@0003
I studied with Syrene and Vanessa,
two of Frelia's finest!@0003@000CAnd you're also a Frelian princess.@0003
You should not be fighting. What
would happen if you were injured?@0003@0009No! I'm not going back!@0003@000CTana!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009I won't go back!@0003@0009@0011@000CWhy does she always
have to be like this?@0003

@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@010F@0009@0017Did you see me out on
the battlefield, Innes?@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0017I knew I made the right decision,
coming out here.@0003
I feel like our strategy is becoming
much better, as is our fighting.@0003
You do agree, don't you, Innes?@0003@0017@000CI grant you some small credit for your
achievements on the field of war.@0003
However, I still insist that you
return to Frelia.@0003@0009Why!?@0003@000CIt's true that you've gained some
experience out on the battlefield.@0003
But your ignorance of the world
around you is simply appalling.@0003
It must be tough for a pampered castle
brat like you to interact with soldiers.@0003@0009If you can say something like that to your
own sister, I'm more worried about you.@0003
Even when you're right--and your
judgment is good, I know--@0003
you're so blunt that I don't think many
people will want to listen to you.@0003@000CNever mind about me. This is
about you, Tana.@0003
If you keep traveling with us, someone
might take advantage of your naiveté.@0003
More than anything, I can't allow
that Ephraim to--@0003@0009What are you saying? Do you
really think Ephraim and I--@0003@000CNo. Even if you're not interested
in him in the slightest, I@0016...@0016@0003
I simply do not want to see
you get hurt.@0003@0009Innes, what are you suggesting?@0003
If that's the way you're going to
be, I just won't talk to you anymore!@0003@0009@0011@000CTana, wait. I'm not finished!@0003@0005

Why can't you understand!?@0003@000CWhy can't you listen to your brother?
Why are you always so stubborn!?@0003@0009You're the stubborn one, Innes!
Why can't you understand how I feel?@0003
You're my only brother, and I have
no one else on whom I can rely@0016...@0016@0003
I don't want to waste our time
together arguing!@0003@000CTana@0016...@0016@0003@0009You don't know how much I envy Eirika
and Ephraim their closeness.@0003
They understand one another's thoughts
and feelings perfectly all the time!@0003
Why aren't we like that? Why do you
never understand me, Innes?@0003@000CTana, wait.@0003
I don't say these things
because I hate you.@0003@0009That's a lie! You're always so
mean to me, Innes!@0003
You make no effort to understand
how I feel.@0003@000CThat's not true.@0003
I'm still your brother, and I think
I know you better than anyone else.@0003@0009@0016...@0016Do you mean that, Innes?@0003@000CAbsolutely.@0003
Do you remember the incident
with the crown?@0003@0009Hm@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016@0005
Oh!@0003@0002
I remember. It was when I was very
little, and I lost Father's crown.@0003
He was so angry with me. I thought
he would never stop yelling.@0003
I was so terrified of his wrath, and
I just couldn't stop crying.@0003
@0017I honestly believed Father would
throw me in the dungeon!@0003
But you searched the castle from top
to bottom, and you found the crown.@0003
And I remember what you told Father
when you brought it back to him:@0003
I took your crown, Father. I wanted to
see what it would look like on my head.@0003
I remember how happy I was when I heard
Father laughing at your words.@0003
I thought I was the luckiest girl in
the world to have a brother like you.@0003@0017@000C@0017I know how you feel better
than anyone else.@0003
And that's no lie.@0003@0017@0009Innes@0016...@0016@0003
@0017I understand now why you
said what you said.@0003
@0017But please, forgive me for
being here, for not going home.@0003
I simply wanted to be near
you, my beloved brother.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003
@0017You win. I'll let you stay.@0003
@0017But you be sure to apologize to
our father when we return home.@0003
@0017And don't worry too much. I'll be
there with you when you do.@0003@0017@0017@0009Really?
I love you, Innes!@0003

What's your name?@0003@0017@000CMarisa.@0003@0009@0017Nice to meet you, Marisa!@0003
I just wanted to tell you how
much I appreciate you all.@0003
Mercenaries, I mean. It's because
of you that we're doing so well.@0003@0017@000CIt's my job, and I'm doing it.
No need to thank me.@0003@0009But I'd always heard mercenaries were
renegades, cutthroats, and oath breakers.@0003
@0017You're nothing like that, though.@0003
So that's why I wanted to thank
you--for fighting so hard for us.@0003@0017@000CIt's not out of loyalty to you
or to any kingdom.@0003
I'm happy as long as I have a
chance to swing my sword.@0003@0009Oh@0016...@0016 Is that so@0016...@0016@0003
@0017But it doesn't matter to me!@0003
You're helping us now, and I
know you'd never betray us.@0003@0017@000CI don't care what you think.@0003@000C@0011@0009But-but@0016...@0016 Oh, wait!@0003@0002

@0017Oh! Have you never seen a pegasus?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016Magnificent.@0003@0009@0017Is this your first time ever
seeing a pegasus up close?@0003@0017@000CYes.@0003
I've fought beside pegasus knights,
but I've never been this close before.@0003@0009@0017Well?@0004 What do you think?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003
I thought they would have more delicate
legs, because they fly so much.@0003@0009@0017Oh, they can gallop quite quickly.
They don't always have to fly.@0003@0017@000CInteresting.
@0016...@0016@0003
It is truly magnificent.
Powerful and beautiful.@0003@0009@0017Would you like to touch him?
Pet his head. Achaeus likes that.@0003@0017@000CTouch@0016...@0016him?@0003@0009@0017Of course. Be my guest.

That is a good name. A strong name.@0003@0009@0017Thanks.@0003
Syrene named him. She's a pegasus
knight. She's sort of my mentor.@0003
Someday, I want to be as graceful
and strong as Syrene.@0003
And then, like Syrene, I'll pass my
experiences on to the next generation.@0003@0017@000BI see. I have no goal but
to master my swordsmanship.@0003@0009@0017Oh, but that's a fine dream! Then
let's keep working, shall we?@0003@0017@000B@0016...@0016Yes.@0003
# 0x0D12
@0009@0010@012C@000C@0010@011E@0009Marisa, is it difficult to
improve your swordsmanship?@0003@000CIt is.@0003
I practice daily. I've fought a
thousand men and won each time.@0003
And still, I have seen only the barest
glimpse of what I could achieve.@0003@0009Really@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Maybe you shouldn't press
yourself so hard.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0017I can see how dedicated you are
to becoming a better swordfighter.@0003
But if you focus too much on a lofty goal,
you might not notice when you reach it.@0003
And I have no doubt you will reach it.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009What is it, Marisa?@0003@000CWhy do you waste your time
speaking with me, Princess?@0003@0009@0017Oh, am I not supposed to do that?@0003@0017@000CIt's not a matter of whether
you should or should not.@0003@0009@0017At first, I thought you were brusque
and@0016...@0016maybe a little intimidating, too.@0003
But you're not like that at all. You're
just shy--and a poor conversationalist.@0003@0017@000CA poor--@0005 You know, many of my
fellow swordsmen still fear me.@0003@0009@0017I'm sure they do. Your grace with
the sword is something else.@0003
But when you're not fighting, you're
completely different. More pensive.@0003
You're so dedicated to your goal. You
have that far-off look in your eyes,@0003
like you're lost in thoughts of love
or something like that.@0003@0017@000CYou've already made up your mind, Princess,
so there's no point in my arguing.@0003@0009@0017Then we agree! Oh, but there's
one more thing.@0003
Just call me Tana. You don't have
to keep calling me Princess.@0003@0017@000CWhy?@0003@0009@0017We're friends now.@0003@0017@000CFriends?@0003@0009@0017That's right! So just call me Tana.@0003
I don't want you to worry about royal
titles and formality when we talk.@0003
You say you've dedicated yourself to
the sword, but@0016...@0016@0003
that doesn't mean you can't have
a friend or two, does it?@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0005
@0017Well, Marisa?@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0005

have done if you'd said no.@0003

How's it going?@0003@0017@0009Gerik@0016...@0016@0003
I'm sorry you had to see
that ugly side of me.@0003@000CHuh? What do you mean?@0003@0009At Renvall, when you stayed by me.@0003
If not for your loyalty, I would have fallen
into the hands of those mercenaries.@0003@000C@0017Ah, well, that's my job, innit?@0003
But what's your point? This
is unlike you, Prince.@0003@0017@0009I've guided men into battle countless
times before that day.@0003
I've always tried to be a model commander,
to guide others by my example.@0003
But@0016...@0016I found that many of my soldiers
wanted a less severe example to follow.@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009But you're different. I've known
that from the day we first met.@0003
How do you stay so composed in
the heat of battle?@0003@000C@0017I don't know how to answer that@0016...@0016@0003
I suppose it's just in my nature.@0003@0002
Long discussions on the battlefield,
however, are not. Let's go already.@0003@0017@0009Ahh@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0D14
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@011B@0009Nice work, Gerik@0016...@0016@0003
I see the Desert Tiger is
still as fierce as ever.@0003@000C@0017I can't believe my skill with the blade
is known in circles as high as yours.@0003
Let me tell you, I didn't get into this
line of work because I like fighting.@0003
It was a twist of fate that started
me on this path@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Really? But I've heard of your fame
from no less a person than my father.@0003
He tells me your name was once known
from shore to shore on this continent.@0003@000C@0017The past is the past. I was just
doing what I had to.@0003
If I hadn't, I never would have
survived.@0003
But there's something about combat
that just doesn't agree with my nature.@0003@0017@0009If that's the case, why are
you with these mercenaries?@0003@000C@0017Ahh@0016... @0016The answer is so simple,
you'll probably laugh.@0003
Back when I was a kid, a friend from my
village said he wanted to be a mercenary.@0003
He said he was going to be famous, the
greatest warrior in all the land.@0003
No matter how many times I told him to
give it up, he wouldn't listen to me.@0003
Well, one day, he left for Jehanna.@0003
I didn't know what else to do, so I went
with him and joined the guild, too.@0003
Stupid reason, isn't it? Anyway@0016...@0016@0003
I didn't particularly like fighting, and
while I wasn't opposed to the money,@0003
I certainly wasn't in it for fame@0016...@0016@0003
I just couldn't let my friend go off
and get killed.@0003@0017@0009And where is this friend now?@0003@000C@0017He went off and got killed.@0003@0017@0009I see@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017So there was no reason for me to
continue being a mercenary@0016...@0016@0003
But then there were other men who I
considered to be my friends.@0003
I couldn't bring myself to abandon them@0016...@0016
And so the years passed and here I am.@0003
The thing is I can't stand to see my 
friends die.@0003
But if you're in this business long enough,
people around you get killed. It happens.@0003
The only thing you can do is keep moving
forward and try not to think about it.@0003
So@0016... @0016Yes, I'd have a problem if you
got yourself killed.@0003
I've got no place else to go, and I'm tired 
of trying to forget.@0003@0017@0009Hmph@0016...@0016
Do you really think I'd lose so easily?@0003
It won't do for you to underestimate me.@0003@000C@0017Oh, uh@0016... @0016Right.@0003@0017
# 0x0D15
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@011B@0009Gerik.@0003@000C@0017Eh?@0003@0017@0009There's something I've always assumed
to be true@0016...@0016@0003
Those born to royalty cannot show
others any weaknesses or deficiencies.@0003
If they're not perfect at all times, their
enemies will take advantage of them.@0003@000C@0017Yeah? So?@0003@0017@0009But meeting you has made me rethink
that belief.@0003
My father told me before I left that
I should watch you and learn from you.@0003
At the time, I believed there was
nothing a mercenary could teach me.@0003
Now I know better. I am thankful to both
my father and you.@0003@000C@0017That's enough of that. In my opinion,
you're much finer than I could ever be.@0003
The way you live, your manners, and your
bearing@0016...@0016 I could never pull it off.@0003@0017@0009Me? What do you mean?@0003@000C@0017Look at you! You're full of confidence.
You've got pride.@0003
When I first met you, I thought,
What a high-handed dandy. @0003@0017@0009Did you just call me@0016...@0016a dandy?@0003@000C@0017But that's just who you are.@0003
Being proud is not always
a bad thing.@0003
You must have worked yourself near to
death to preserve that pride.@0003
What I mean is that you never make
excuses for losing or being beaten up.@0003
No matter the pain you face or hardship, 
you keep on fighting to honor that pride.@0003
It's what defines you, and I can't
say that I don't admire it.@0003@0017@0009It comes naturally.@0003
I will be king one day, and I will make
Frelia the greatest nation in all the world.@0003
It will be a wonderful kingdom of wealth 
and power.@0003
When that day comes, I will command you
to become general and lead Frelia's armies.@0003
@0017No, I'll have you come and ask me to
make you general.@0003@0017@000C@0017Ha ha ha! I can't wait!@0003@0017

@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0122@000CWell, hello.@0003@0009Imagine meeting you here.@0003@000CYes@0016... @0016You know, I believe this is
our first chance to speak privately.@0003
I am L'Arachel of the Theocracy of Rausten.
It's a pleasure to meet you.@0003@0009I believe you already know my name.@0003
I am Innes, prince of Frelia.@0003@000CSpeaking of Frelia@0016... @0016Oh, I remember,
the seafood was delicious there.@0003@0009Yes. I would agree that the fish of
my homeland is not unpleasant.@0003@000CYes.@0003
@0017However it does not compare with
that of my home, Rausten.@0003@0017@0009Is that so?@0003
I know not what fish your country
has to offer, but I have a hard time@0003
imagining they could be that much
tastier than our own.@0003@000CYour doubt is not surprising.@0003
Once this war is over, you must
come and visit Rausten.@0003
I think it best if you try a wide
variety of our fish for yourself.@0003@0009That's a good idea.
I will most certainly do so.@0003
And perhaps you have not tasted
all the fish Frelia has to offer.@0003
To be sure, you should visit again.
Perhaps a culinary exchange is in order.@0003
@0017It may be you change your opinion.@0003@0017@000CWe'll see.@0006
Very well, I accept your invitation.@0003
I will visit your country once more
and taste your national dishes.@0003
# 0x0D17
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0122@0009L'Arachel.@0003@000CYes?@0003@0009Are you sure you're supposed
to be here?@0003
I wonder if you're truly here with the
permission of your superiors.@0003@000COf-of course I am!@0003
What gives you the right to speak
to me in such a manner?@0003@0009Well, I have heard a bit about
your wild behavior@0016...@0016@0003@000CH-how rude you are!@0003
If I were not a holy woman, I
would beat you senseless.@0003@0009How savage YOU are.@0003
Perhaps you could learn self-control by
observing Frelia's pegasus knights.@0003
@0017Yes, there's something I'd like to show you.@0003
When the Frelia's pegasi gather
in Walles Forest@0016...@0016@0003
It's a spectacle of such beauty@0016...@0016@0003@0017@000CIf it is beauty you seek, then
Rausten is second to none.@0003
Do you know of Rausten's lofty
peak Mount Mimir.@0003
@0017I pity those who die without having
gazed upon its breathtaking beauty.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016@0003
If you recommend it so highly, then
yes, I would indeed like to see it.@0003@000CYes. That would be splendid
indeed.@0003
But there are many more equally
beautiful places in Rausten.@0003@0009Then perhaps you should tell me
about them for future reference.@0003
And in return, I shall take time to tell you
about the beautiful places in my kingdom.@0003@000CYes, I would love to hear more.@0003
# 0x0D18
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0122@0009The Theocracy of Rausten certainly
sounds like a spectacular land.@0003@000CAs does Frelia, much more
than I imagined it would.@0003
And yet@0016...@0016@0003@0009You mean to ask which is the
more spectacular? Is that it?@0003@000CWhat? That's no question at all!
Rausten is clearly superior in every way.@0003@0009I expected you would say so.@0003
But what of the truth?
Your opinion is subjective, is it not?@0003@000CWell@0016...@0016um@0016...@0016
All opinions are subjective,@0003
but I'm sure an objective evaluation
would yield the same result.@0003@0009To prove that, we will need some
fair and impartial third in our discussion.@0003@000C@0017Indeed! And I have
a splendid idea.@0003
Let the pair from Renais judge.@0003
Surely Ephraim and Eirika can come to
a proper decision.@0003@0017@0017@0009Of course. I agree completely.@0003
I think I should remind the two of all
the wonder Frelia holds.@0003@000CThen it's decided.@0003
They will visit both of our homes, and
we'll show them such splendor as to@0003
leave them breathless.@0003
Invitations to tour our two nations
will surely have them overjoyed.@0003@0009It would only be natural.@0003@000CIt would be natural.@0003
Very well then. Let us deal with this
evil and take those two home with us.@0003
First and foremost, it is a competition
to see whose land is more magnificent!@0003@0009@0017I can see this whole affair has
you very enthralled.@0003
I cannot say where this little
competition will lead us@0016...@0016@0003
@0017But I am more than happy to go
up against you.@0003@000CDon't blame me if you regret
our contest later, though.@0003
You may be composed before others, but
you'll surely be lonely on your own.@0003@0009Be warned yourself. Your words here may
prove embarrassing to you later.@0003@000CIt's not a problem.@0003
This is just another contest
in the name of all that is holy and true.@0003@0009Ah, very well then.@0003
# 0x0D19
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Tethys.
How are you feeling?@0003@0017@0017@0009Oh, Chief. Things are as fine
as one could expect.@0003
But I've been dancing so much
I've worked up quite a sweat.@0003
At this rate I may even lose a few
inches off of my waistline.@0003
Who knows, maybe my figure will be
even more alluring than before.@0003@000CHa ha ha! Well, I'm not sure that's even
possible, but keep up the good work.@0003
Your dancing has had quite a restorative 
effect on the troops.@0003@0009Really? I'm happy to hear it. I
must keep dancing then, mustn't I?@0003@0002
Oh, I almost forgot, Chief.@0003
I have good news, and then I have
better news.@0003@000CWhat's the good news?@0003@0009I hear today's meal is one of
your favorites, herbed stew.@0003@000COh, that is good news! It's been quite
a while since I've had any.@0003
And the even better news?@0003@0009In this next battle, you'll get your hands
on some sort of an incredible treasure.@0003@000CA treasure?@0003@0009Yes, that's right, some sort of treasure.@0003@000CHa ha ha! I see. I don't know what it
might be, but I can't wait for it.@0003
Nor for today's meal.@0003@0009I'm going to continue dancing a bit longer
so as to work up a healthy appetite.@0003@000CSo tell me, Tethys, when did
you first start dancing?@0003@0017@0009Oh@0016...@0016
Well, that would have been@0016...@0016@0003@000CHm?@0006
What's the matter?@0003@0009Um, well@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Yes, it was long ago.
Back when Ewan was still young.@0003@0017@000CWhat is it, Tethys?@0003@0009@0016...@0016I'm sorry, Chief. I'll explain  it 
another time. Can we drop it for now?@0003@000CTethys@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0D1A
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@011B@0009Chief.@0003
The truth is, Ewan and I? We were
abandoned by our parents.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0005
Oh, I see@0016...@0016@0003@0009Um@0016...@0016@0003
I wandered about with little Ewan in tow.
He had no idea what was happening.@0003
I was a child myself with no job.@0003
We went to bed hungry every night,
and our clothes were rags@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Then one day I said to myself,
We cannot go on like this!@0003
I watched a dancer on a street corner
and memorized all of her moves.@0003
I wasn't a very coordinated child and
it was so difficult.@0003
I didn't have real shoes, so my feet
were a mess of blisters,@0003
and I fell so many times I was covered
in cuts and bruises.@0003
It was painful. And miserable. And
very, very difficult. But I never cried.@0003
Because if were to cry, he would cry.
And I loved seeing Ewan's smiling face.@0003
I wanted him to smile all the time,
so I worked hard so he could.@0003@0017@000CTethys@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017Tee hee hee. What a sad and
miserable tale. I'm sorry.@0003
I was reminded of it all just recently,
and I was overcome with emotion@0016...@0016@0003
But that's how I earned the dancing skills
and physique I have now!@0003
All of the hard work I did back then 
has made me the woman I am today.@0003@0017@0009@0080@001F@0005@0009@0080@001C@0009
@0017What do you say to that?@0003@0017@000CI'm not sure what to say.@0003
So before you met up with us, the two of you
had a rough time of it, did you?@0003@0009@0017OK, that's enough. The past is the past!
You mustn't tell anyone about this.@0003
I don't share this story with others.
I only told you because you're the chief.@0003
A story of toil and hardship doesn't quite 
fit my mysterious image, does it?@0003@0002
You know what I'd like?@0005
For you to tell me more about you.@0003@0017@0017@000CSure. Another time, though, OK?@0003@0009All right. Let's see this
thing through to the end.@0003
If we do our best, good things will come
of it. And then better things after that.@0003
Right, Chief?@0003@000CRight, Tethys. You be careful.@0003@0009Of course! And you too, Chief!@0003
# 0x0D1B
@0009@0010@011B@000C@0010@011C@000CUm, Chief, there's actually one
thing I've been wanting to ask you.@0003@0009And what's that?@0003@000CSorry if this brings up any bad memories, but
how'd you get that scar on your face?@0003@0009This?@0003
I got this beauty when I had
just started out as a mercenary.@0003@0002
I was still a novice, but I was feeling
pretty good about my swordsmanship.@0003
I got to a point where I was arrogant
enough to believe no one could best me.@0003
Then one day it happened@0016... @0016It's something
I've never been able to forget.@0003@000CWhat happened?@0003@0009It was just another battle. I'd been hired
on as another sword and then I met him.@0003
He was a knight from some country
or another.@0003
I had fought knights on several other
occasions and had beaten them all.@0003
Even though he was a bit tougher,
I was sure I'd defeat him in the end.@0003
That's what I thought.@0003
But@0016...@0016@0003@0002
His strength was beyond me. I may as well 
have been using a broomstick to fight.@0003
I remember thinking, What a tiny little
world I've been living in.@0003
He crushed me effortlessly, and the wound
he inflicted became this lovely scar.@0003@000CI see@0016...@0016@0003@0009I was truly frightened. It was the first
time I'd experienced fear as a mercenary.@0003
So this knight saw how scared I was
and said, Go.@0003
He didn't kill me.
He let me escape.@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003@0009I was humiliated and ashamed.@0003
My eyes were finally opened to 
my own weakness.@0003
It goes without saying I lost every
shred of self-confidence.@0003@0002
@0005I still dream about it sometimes.
It wakes me up every time.@0003
I've never forgotten that knight.
He thought I was weak and pathetic.@0003@000CChief@0016...@0016@0003@0009I was young and stupid.
This scar is my punishment.@0003@000CBut that knight
spared your life.@0003
Because of that, good things and
better things have happened?@0003@0009What do you mean, Tethys?@0003@000CFirst of all, Chief, you're alive.@0003
If you had died, all the good times
you've had since that day,@0003
and all the joy you're sure to have
from this day onward, wouldn't exist.@0003
And another thing, because you lived, you
made many friends and you met me.@0003
I also don't think that knight thought
you were pathetic.@0003
I think he saw a young man with his whole
life ahead of him.@0003
That's why he let you go.@0003@0009Tethys@0016...@0016@0003@000CYep. @0005I'm sure that's it. So try
thinking about it in a more positive light.@0003@0009Ha ha ha. @0004You're right.
I was a lot calmer after that.@0003
And while I've had hard times,
there've been far more good times.@0003
I guess you could say I owe my success
as a mercenary to that knight.@0003@000CYep.
You've got your knight,@0003
and I've got my dancer. Thanks to the
two of them, the two of us are here now.@0003
Say, Chief, why don't we become like them?@0003
I think we should work at being
inspirations to other people.@0003@0009Hm@0016...@0016good idea.@0003@0002
Thanks, Tethys.
I think I'll sleep soundly tonight.@0003@000CGood.@0005
You know, Chief, I'm really happy.@0003@0009Yeah, me, too. I've got a life I enjoy 
and good companions.@0003
All that and a wonderful woman to love.
Everyone should be so lucky.@0003@000COh!@0005 Chief!@0003@0015@000C@0080@000C@0009@0080@000A@001C@000A@0080@001D@0008Whoa!@0006
@0016...@0016@0003
@0008@0080@001E@0008Hey now@0016... @0016This is a battlefield.
This isn't the place for that@0016...@0016@0003@000ANo one's looking@0016...@0016@0003@0008Um@0016...@0016

you, you were always working alone.@0003

@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@011B@000C@0017Hello, Saleh!@0003@0017@0009Gerik@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Imagine! You and me fighting together.
Life's full of surprises, isn't it?@0003@0017@0009I suppose so.@0003@000CSo, what do you think of our commander?@0003@0009I'm here.
There's your answer.@0003@000C@0017Good point.@0003
You know this job seems to have more
meaning than any of my previous ones.@0003
And it's not because it deals with the
continent and all the nations and all that.@0003
I simply want to accomplish my employer's
goals. That's my prime motivation.@0003@0017@0009I think it will all work out.
As long as you and I are here@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Ha ha ha! Well said.
No one can touch us, is that it?@0003
I do imagine with us in the field
we'll win most battles, eh?@0003
Can't get overconfident, though.@0003@0017@0009Mm.@0003
@0016......@0016@0003@000CHuh?
What is it?@0003@0009Gerik@0016...@0016
Do you@0016...@0016@0003@000CDo I what?@0003@0009Nothing@0016...@0016
Pay me no mind.@0003@000C@0017C'mon, now.
What is it?@0003@0017@0009Forgive me.
It's nothing@0016...@0016@0003@000CAll right@0016...@0016@0005
@0017Well then, let's get going.@0003
When there's a break in the fighting,
we should get together for a meal.@0003@0017@0009Very well.@0003
We'll eat to our mutual good fortune@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Yes, to luck!@0003@0017
# 0x0D20
@0009@0010@011B@000C@0010@0120@0009@0017Tell me, Saleh, how fares the elder?@0003@0017@000CShe hasn't changed a bit.@0003@0009@0017Is that so?@0003
@0017You know I was so surprised the
first time I visited Caer Pelyn.@0003
The elder's eyes@0016...@0016they were not the
eyes of your average person.@0003
They were filled with a lifetime's wisdom
and seemed to look right through you.@0003
Deep@0016...@0016and sharp.
And they were so clear.@0003
I've looked into the eyes of many people,
but no one had eyes like hers.@0003
But the thing about the elder is that
her eyes weren't harsh, or judgmental.@0003
@0017That's what I like about her.@0003
Actually, when I first met her, she
intimidated me.@0003
But she treated me with such kindness.@0003
She's why I grew to enjoy Caer Pelyn, 
even if it doesn't have any nightlife!@0003
I want you to take good care of
the elder, Saleh.@0003@0017@000CYes, I intend to.@0003@0009You say the right words, Saleh, but
are you being sincerely considerate?@0003@000CConsiderate?@0003
When I'm home, I look after 
her personal belongings.@0003
I also take care of her meals and
watch over her health@0016...@0016@0003@0009That's only natural. You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?@0003
@0017That's just like you, though.@0003@0017@000CIs there@0016...@0016something else
I should be doing?@0003@0009Next time you go home, make
sure you take her a gift.@0003
Bring her some jewelry or something
that's popular in town.@0003@000CBut@0016...@0016@0005
I don't know what she likes@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh, please, Saleh.
That's not the issue.@0003
Simply receiving that sort of present
from her grandson will make her happy.@0003@000COh@0016...@0016is that so?@0003@0009@0017That's what I'm trying to tell you.@0003@0017@000CI understand.
I'll take it into consideration.@0003@0009@0017When we next pass through a city,
I'll help you pick something out.@0003@0017@000CThat would be helpful.@0003@0009Studying magic is all well and good, but you
should pay attention to these things, too.@0003
@0017And in your case, you need to work on
understanding women's hearts.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003
I'll look into it.@0003@0009@0017Ha ha ha.@0004
I'll help you out in that area, too.@0003@0017

You look even more serious than usual.@0003@0017@000CGerik@0016...@0016
You truly despise me, don't you?@0003@0009Huh?!@0005
What?@0003@000CI@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003@000CYour friend, I@0016...@0016@0003@0009Don't say it, Saleh!@0006
That was an act of fate. Right?@0003
All you did was brush those sparks
away from yourself.@0003@000CGerik@0016...@0016@0003@0009Listen, we're mercenaries.@0003
We end up working together with old foes,
and crossing blades with former allies.@0003
It's just part of the job.@0003
My friend Zabba died by your act.
That much is true.@0003
And at that moment, I could think of 
nothing but avenging him!@0003
But after that, you saved my life@0016...@0016@0003
We became friends.
That's the truth of it, isn't it?@0003@000CYes@0016...@0016@0003@0009I trust you now.
You are my friend.@0003
I'm not lying to you.
I don't lie to my friends.@0003
That's something I don't do.@0003@000CAnd you are my friend.@0003
Since that day, it's you who
has saved me time and time again.@0003@0009@0017We're all human after all.
Helping our friends is part of our nature.@0003@0017@000CGerik@0016...@0016@0003
You@0016...@0016
You're a good man@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017That's enough of that! You keep that up
and I'll be blushing like a schoolgirl.@0003@0017@000C@0017Ha!@0003@0017@0017@0009Hey! Ha ha ha! I caught a rare
glimpse of you smiling.@0003
Listen, Saleh, I know we're risking our lives
here, but this war's not our whole lives.@0003
Let's not do anything stupid.
We're going to get past this.@0003
Then you're going to haul your carcass back
to Caer Pelyn and care for the elder!@0003@000CYes@0016...@0016
And you'll visit, too.@0003@0009Sure. When things calm down
I'll let you throw me a feast.@0003
I can't wait to have Caer Pelyn's
famous mutton stew again.@0003@000CWe'll be waiting for you, Gerik.@0003
# 0x0D22
@0017@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0121@000CHey, Tethys!
Check out my magic!?@0003@0009@0017Ewan! How many times am I going to
have to say it?@0003
This isn't a field trip.
Please promise me you'll behave.@0003@0017@000COh, you don't have to worry about me.@0003
But since I'm here, I'd like to be of
use. Otherwise I'm just in the way.@0003
You gotta let me do something.@0003@0009You have a point, but
you're still too young.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000CToo young? I'm not a child anymore!
I can look after myself!@0003@0009What are you talking about?
You're not a full-fledged mage, are you?@0003@000CWell, no, not yet. But someday I'm gonna
be one of the best mages ever!@0003
These soldiers recognize my talent. That's
why I'm here on the battlefield.@0003
Just watch me! You wouldn't say that I'm
too young or inexperienced if you saw me!@0003@000C@0011@0009@0080@000C@000AWait! Ewan, wait up!@0003
Oh, he's gone@0016...@0016@0003
Only a child would say something like,
Just watch me.@0003
# 0x0D23
@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@011C@0009Hey, Tethys. You've been getting pretty
chummy with that guy lately.@0003@000CWhat do you mean, Ewan?
Who's that guy?@0003@0009You know, THAT guy.
Look, he's right over there@0016...@0016@0003
And that guy waving his sword around@0016...@0016@0003
I'd say you've been a little too friendly
with all of them!@0003@000CToo friendly? I wonder. I think
chatting now and again is normal.@0003
@0017Wait a minute@0016...@0016
Ewan, are you feeling jealous?@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009D-don't be stupid.
That's not it at all!@0003@000C@0017Hold on.@0003
You know, that man told me he found
a frog in his boots the other day.@0003
And that man woke up to find
half his moustache shaved off.@0003
You wouldn't know anything about
that, would you?@0003@0017@0009N-no. This is the first I've heard of it.@0003@000CReally?@0003@0009Um, yeah@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Ooh! It WAS you, wasn't it?@0003
Ewan, you can't do things like that.
Even if it is kind of funny.@0003@0017@0009But they're morons! All they do is get
you to dance, and then they run around@0003
on the battlefield challenging each other
to contests of strength and valor!@0003
They're dumb braggarts, and I was just
taking 'em down a peg.@0003
But I'm not jealous!@0003@000C@0017All right, all right.@0003
I'll keep your secret this time, 
but you must stop!@0003@0017@0009They're the troublemakers, you know?
Oh@0016...@0016OK. I got it.@0003
I'll leave 'em alone.
But, Tethys?@0003@000C@0017What is it?@0003@0017@0009I'll always be here to protect you.
I'm not too young for that!@0003
So instead of always helping those guys,
dance for me once in a while.@0003
@0017I know it'll make me stronger!@0003@0017@0017@000CEwan@0016...@0016@0003@0009I'll see you later!
You gotta promise to dance for me!@0003
# 0x0D24
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0121@000CIt's not such a good idea for you
to dance too close to the front lines.@0003@0009@0017Hee hee!
Thanks for worrying about me, Ewan.@0003
But are you sure it's not just the
jealousy talking?@0003@0017@000CTh-that's not it at all!
It's dangerous! That's it!@0003@0009@0017I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But you know, Ewan@0016...@0016@0003
Since you joined up with the army,
you really have gotten stronger.@0003@0017@0017@000CI have, haven't I?
So I'm no longer a novice, right?@0003@0009No, you've truly grown.
I'm glad, but also a little sad.@0003@0017@000CHmm. So when I'm a full-fledged
mage, you're gonna be sad?@0003@0009I guess so. A little sad, anyways.@0003
I'm so much older than you that I've
always thought of you as a child.@0003
That's why I always thought I had
to protect you.@0003@000CYou know, at the beginning of all of this 
I really was treating it like a game.@0003
Then I saw the dangers you faced to
help everyone.@0003
I knew I couldn't treat it like a game
any longer.@0003
@0015@000C@0080@000D@000BBattles threaten people's lives and need
to end quickly.@0003
That's why I need to boost my powers.
I want to help you and the others.@0003
I have to become a full-fledged mage
to really do my part.@0003
So, don't be sad.
I just want to protect you@0016...@0016@0003@0009Ewan@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@000C@0005@000BYou've been looking after your little
brother for so many years.@0003
Now it's my turn to return the favor.
@0017I mean, I am the man of the family.@0003
So from now on, I'm gonna be helping 
you out.@0003@0017@0017@000AThank you, Ewan. Hearing you say
that makes me very happy.@0003
It proves to me how much you've
truly grown.@0003
@0017But that doesn't mean you need to
rush off on your own or anything.@0003
@0017If I thought you didn't need me
anymore, I would feel really sad.@0003@000BThere's no reason to get all weepy.@0003
No matter how old I get, you'll always
be my big sister. My one and only.@0003
# 0x0D25
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011C@000C@0017Say, Marisa, you're left-handed, right?@0003@0017@0009How did you know that?@0003@000C@0017Well, when you're carrying a sword, don't
you always have it in your left hand?@0003@0017@0009No, I can use either hand@0016...@0016
But my left hand is stronger.@0003@000CSo that's like a warning sign:
left hand equals danger.@0003@0009Warning sign@0016...@0016@0003@000CSo why is it you always sleep on your
right side?@0003
You know you never roll over
in your sleep?@0003
And even the slightest noise causes you
to spring up. Do you ever really sleep?@0003@0009I have to do that.
Otherwise I wouldn't survive.@0003@000CWouldn't survive?
@0017You must be exaggerating.@0003@0017@0009I sleep with my dominant arm up.@0003
That way, if I'm attacked, my good arm
is ready to go.@0003@000CHuh@0016...@0016@0003
Do all sword fighters sleep that way?@0003@0009If your dominant arm is cut, you're
at a disadvantage in battle.@0003
That means death.@0003@000CBut doesn't your arm ever fall asleep?
Aren't there times when you can't use it?@0003@0009No. My father trained me when I was
a child, so that doesn't happen.@0003@000CWhen you were a child? How?
Kids always roll around in their sleep.@0003@0009My father placed blunt swords at my sides
when I slept to keep me from moving.@0003@000CYour father did that?
But that's so dangerous@0016...@0016@0003@0009No, the blades were rounded and dull. And it
worked. I don't roll over when sleeping.@0003@000CWow, sword fighters have some intense
training methods, don't they?@0003
@0017I'm glad I was an average kid. I mean, I
was poor, but at least I slept freely.@0003@0017

@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@011E@000CTethys.
Are you right-handed?@0003@0009@0017Will wonders never cease?
You actually started a conversation.@0003@0017@000CWhen you dance, you often
begin by putting your right foot forward.@0003@0009@0017Now I'm really amazed.
I can't believe you noticed.@0003
But footwork in dancing has nothing to do
with being right- or left-handed.@0003
Dancing is a way of expressing feelings
through body movement.@0003
All of one's experiences are incorporated
and displayed in the way one dances.@0003@0017@000CExperiences?
What kind of experiences?@0003@0009@0017That, my dear, is my little secret.
Mine may be a bit unique, though.@0003
My life's taken some odd turns, but it's
because of them that I started dancing.@0003
And when I'm dancing, I'm happy.@0003@0017@000CHmmm.
Your dances give people courage.@0003
Dancing suits you.@0003@0009@0017Doesn't it, though?
All the mercenaries tell me that, too.@0003
Now that you understand my dancing, you're
truly a member of Gerik's team.@0003@0017
# 0x0D27
@0009@0010@011E@000C@0010@011C@000CTell me, Marisa, have you ever thought
about wanting to be reborn?@0003@0009Reborn?@0003@000CYou know, coming back as someone else
after you die?@0003
If you were going to be reborn,
what would you like to be?@0003
@0017Perhaps a beautiful dancer like me?@0003@0017@0009I'm fine with being me.
I can't imagine anything else.@0003@000C@0017I thought that's what you'd say.@0003
Actually, I thought of lots of things, but
really can't imagine any other life.@0003
I guess that means that in spite of all the
hardships we've faced, we're really happy.@0003@0017@0009I suppose so@0016...@0016@0003@000CLiving in this age means that we face many 
bad things and then worse things. Yet@0016...@0016@0003
@0017We're alive, so that means we also get
good things and then better things, too.@0003
In tough times, I sometimes think I'd like
to be reborn in another time, but the@0003
important thing is to not give up and to
live your life to the fullest.@0003@0017@0009When you die, life is over.
There's no such thing as being reborn.@0003@000C@0017Well, you may be right.@0003@0017@0009We only get one chance.
So all I can do is keep fighting.@0003@000C@0017After all's said and done, you truly
like who and what you are, right?@0003
We have completely different lives, but
we have that in common.@0003
That and the same man, right?@0003@0017@0009What?!@0004
What do you mean?!?@0003@000C@0017You can't hide it from me.@0003
I guess I should ask,
do you think you're hiding it?@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@0009I-I'm hiding nothing.
Nothing at all!@0003@000C@0017What an interesting reaction.

Perhaps we could talk another time.@0003@000CIs that so? Very well then.
Another day.@0003@0009Yes.@0003@000CAnd perhaps I could have you
dance for me and me alone.@0003@0009@0017Hm?@0003
I will of course dance if you ask, but@0016...@0016
For you and you alone?@0003
@0017Are you perhaps attempting to woo me?
If that's the case, you should stop. I've@0016...@0016@0003@000CNo, no, that's not what I
was intending at all.@0003
Yet many women who say they're not
interested end up in my arms all the same.@0003@0009@0017Well, if that's the case,
@0017maybe I'll keep my eye on you.@0003
If you turn out to be such a catch,
I may rethink my stance.@0003@000CIt's a deal then.@0003
I ask that you observe my
conduct closely.@0003
Good day.@0003@000C@0011@0006@0009@0017Oh, dear@0016...@0016
I think he took me seriously.@0003
I hope he doesn't get his
hopes up too high.@0003@0017

@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0124@000C@0017Ah, the beauteous Tethys.
It's a pleasure to see you again.@0003
Well? Have I made an impression on 
you yet?@0003@0017@0009Well@0016...@0016@0003
@0017You seem to be@0016...@0016unobjectionable.@0003
Yet you've a long way to go, I think.@0003@0017@0017@000CThat's a bit severe, isn't it?
Is there something specific you desire?@0003@0009Oh, well@0016...@0016perhaps you could
bring me something?@0003@000CBring you something?
A gift, is that it?@0003
Very well. What shall it be?@0003@0009Um@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0D2A
@0009@0010@011C@000C@0010@0124@0009Oh.@0003@000C@0017Tethys.
I've been looking for you.@0003
@0017You haven't been avoiding me, have you?@0003@0009@0017Oh, of course not.
Hee hee@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0017@000CThe object you spoke of the other day?
I have it here. Please take a look.@0003@0009@0017Um.
@0017Oh, yes. That. Of course.@0003@000C@0017You forgot what you
asked for, didn't you?@0003@0017@0009@0017That's, that's@0016...@0016@0017not true.@0003@000COK, then take a look.
Here it is.@0003@0009Ooh@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat do you think?@0003@0009It's nice.
Very pretty.@0003@000CIt's as big as a fist.@0003
Notice how the red, white, and blue colors
play across the surface of the gems.@0003@0009It really exists.@0003@000CDid you say something?@0003@0009No, nothing. Pay me no mind.@0003@000CWell, I brought it to you
as promised.@0003
So this proves that
I'm worthy, does it not?@0003@0009@0017Yes.@0003
I now realize that despite your appearance,
you're a very hard worker.@0003
@0017Does that make you a good catch?
Hmm@0016...@0016I'm still not convinced.@0003@000CReally?
How disappointing.@0003
Is there something else you desire?@0003@0009Let me see@0016...@0016
There is this@0016...@0016@0003

Um@0016...@0016@0003@000CMay I help you?@0003@0009Saleh, wherever we go, you're
always at my side.@0003
Don't you ever do anything
YOU want to do?@0003@000CI came from Caer Pelyn.@0003
I have been entrusted with the
honor of being your escort.@0003
Protecting you, Great Dragon,
gives my life meaning.@0003@0009Great Dragon? Please, there's
no need to call me that.@0003
My father is the great one.@0003
I've done nothing. I'm not
great at all.@0003@000CIt is true, Great Dragon, that your
exalted father once saved mankind.@0003
On that day so long ago, he shielded
us from evil. He is our true savior.@0003
However, mankind has forgotten that
most sacred debt we owe him.@0003
I do, as we all must, what I can to
atone for that crime of neglect.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CGreat Dragon, does my presence
bother you?@0003
If it does, please do not hesitate
to tell me.@0003
I would remove myself at once and
not bother you again until needed.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
It's fine. Do whatever
pleases you.@0003@000C@0016...@0016Thank you.@0003

You're from Caer Pelyn.@0003
Do you know if my father has ever
visited your village?@0003@000CHe has. I myself have never seen
his noble personage.@0003
However, I have heard that Dara
met him once when she was young.@0003
Some monsters had wandered into Caer
Pelyn, and the Great Dragon saved us.@0003@0009Really?@0003
I wonder why my father
chose to help you.@0003@000CThat, I cannot guess.@0003
We poor humans cannot hope to grasp
the thinking of the Great Dragon.@0003@0009@0016...@0016@0003
My father has dedicated his life
to protecting humans.@0003
For the longest time, I could not
fathom why he would do this.@0003
But now, after spending time
with all of you@0016...@0016@0003@0002
@0017I begin to understand how he felt.@0003@0017@000CGreat Dragon@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0017I'm sure that I@0016--@0016@0003
that I will continue to fight,
as he did, for all humanity.@0003@0017@000CI am truly grateful that you
feel that way, Great Dragon.@0003

I know I'm being rude, but
I've a favor to ask.@0003@000CWhat is it?@0003@0009Would you please come
to our village?@0003@000CTo Caer Pelyn?@0003
But@0016...@0016@0003@0009Dara and the other villagers
would be overjoyed to see you.@0003
The village is quite spare, but we
would do our best to entertain you.@0003
You could stay for as long as you
wanted@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016...@0016@0003
Saleh, you made that request
on my behalf, didn't you?@0003@0009No, not at all.@0003
I apologize. I have
been disrespectful.@0003@000C@0017No, I'm pleased.@0003
@0017However@0016...@0016@0003
I doubt I should
stay too long.@0003@0009Why is that?@0003@000CIt's because I'm a dragon.@0003
My father explained it to me.@0003
We are both human and monster.@0003
And because we are both, we
are also neither.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWe have the power of dragons; therefore,
we cannot live together with humans@0016...@0016@0003
We have the hearts of humans; therefore,
we do not belong with monsters.@0003
We are outcasts in this world, never
a part of either community.@0003
And so we live our lives alone, never
to be understood by anyone.@0003@0009But there are humans whose actions make
them monsters in the eyes of others.@0003
I do not think of you as such when there are
many worse monsters among my own kind.@0003
Regardless, I believe the villagers would
be most pleased to have you visit.@0003@000CSaleh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Thank you. Your words have cheered
me up a little.@0003
Please wait for my answer. When all
of this is finished@0016...@0016@0003
When peace returns, I'll give you
my answer then.@0003@0017@0009I understand.@0003@000C@0017And when I do return to Darkling
Woods, I will not be sad.@0003
Because of the time I've spent with
you, the memories you've given me,@0003
I shall not be lonely. I shall
never feel like an outcast again.@0003@0017@0009Lady Myrrh@0016...@0016@0003

@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0121@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000C@0017Teacher!@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003
Oh, Ewan!@0003@000C@0017You were practicing Valega, weren't you?@0003
@0017To know the harmony of heaven and earth,
body and spirit@0016...@0016@0017right?@0003@0017@0009Yes, you are correct.@0003@000CUm@0016...@0016To contemplate oneself@0016...@0016
And@0016...@0016what was the rest?@0003@0009To contemplate the world and to envision
all creation. Thus, to be enlightened.@0003@000C@0017Oh, that's right.@0003
Doesn't it get to be a bother finding
a quiet place like this, though?@0003@0017@0009Contemplation takes time, Ewan. It doesn't
matter where, so long as you do it.@0003@000COh@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Well, if Valega is an important part of
Caer Pelyn's culture and history,@0003
I think I might give it a try.@0003@0017@0009Really? And I wonder how many
days you'll last at that.@0003@000C@0017Heh. I guess you're right. Knowing the
harmony of the heavens sounds tough.@0003
Do you have anything easier I could
practice in the meantime?@0003@0017@0009Hm. Let me think. Your skill level
is still quite low, but@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Thanks, Teacher.@0003
I remember when you first decided
to teach me some magic.@0003
I was so excited that I went out
and practiced over and over again.@0003@0017@0009You must pace yourself. Using too much
magic can drain both body and soul.@0003@000C@0017Yeah. Boy, I know that.@0003
After that time, I was so tired
that I couldn't stay awake.@0003
I was so tired that I slept for
a full day. I woke up in bed@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009Technically, it was two days.@0003@000C@0017Oh, so that was you who
carried me home?@0003@0017@0009Mm-hm.@0003@000C@0017Now that I think about it, no one
else would have bothered! Thank you.@0003@0017@0009Ewan, don't push yourself too
hard. Magic is no game.@0003@000C@0017I know, and don't worry!@0003@0017
# 0x0D2F
@0009@0010@0120@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Teacher.@0003@0017@0009What is it, Ewan?@0003@000C@0017Do you remember a few years ago when
you went to visit Commander Gerik?@0003
That was when I met you and followed
you back to Caer Pelyn.@0003
I never said thank you for taking me
in, Teacher. I've never regretted it.@0003@0017@0009I remember it clearly. I kept thinking,
What have I gotten myself into?@0003@000CIf that's the way you felt about it,
why did you let me be your student?@0003@0009Your eyes.@0003@000CMy eyes?@0003@0009You had a spark in your eyes.@0003
I knew that I saw an exceptional
talent for magic in those eyes.@0003@000C@0017Wow. That's really something.
I would never have guessed.@0003@0017@0009I'm sure, as your training progresses,
that you will feel your power grow.@0003@000C@0017I'll train even harder, then!@0003
Back when I first started, I@0016...@0016
thought you were kinda scary.@0003@0017@0009Me?@0003@000C@0017Well, you don't really talk much.@0003
I always thought you were angry
with me, and I didn't know why.@0003@0017@0009All that because I was so silent
all the time?@0003@000C@0017Yep. But after a while, I figured
out it was just the way you were.@0003@0017@0009Ewan, you can never find truth in
words, spoken or unspoken.@0003
Truth lives within the heart.@0003@000CBut other people can't see what's
inside your heart, can they?@0003@0009If you can trust one another, you
can see. And you will understand.@0003@000COh! Is that how it works?
@0017I think I get it now.@0003
But talking is so important in
building friendships, isn't it?@0003
We use words to communicate things
like feelings and ideas.@0003
But all that stuff, it's just on
the surface. Does that mean that@0003
if people use their hearts, they
can communicate without using words?@0003@0017@0009That's right.@0003@000C@0017You really are great, Teacher.@0003
You teach me by making me teach myself,
and I mean more than just magic@0016...@0016@0003
@0016...@0016Remember how angry you were at
me that one time?@0003
Back when I took out that magic tome?@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003
I wasn't angry that you
took the tome out with you.@0003
It's that you took it with you
without asking and went for a stroll.@0003
And then you stopped to
play in the river@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017That's right. Then I dropped it and
SPLASH!! Right in it went@0016...@0016@0003
It wasn't in the water long, but those
pages were totally illegible@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009That utter carelessness@0016--@0016
No, your lack of consideration.@0003
That's what made me angry.@0003@000C@0017I'm s-sorry.@0003
@0017But I never took any books with
me when I went to the river after that.@0003@0009And there were other things, as well.@0003@000COh, you don't mean@0016...@0016that?
Oh, yeah. @0017Ha ha ha.@0003@0017@0009Unbelievable@0016...@0016@0003
I've never had a student
so troublesome as you.@0003@000C@0017But I promise to be much more
careful in the future!@0003@0017@0009Is there even a shred of
truth in those words?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CY-yikes!@0003@0009You rascal@0016...@0016@0003

all my scrolls and magical items, and@0016...@0016@0003
keep them for your own.@0003@000CWhat? Why would you say that?@0003@0009This conflict has grown bitter. I'm
not sure I'll see it to its end.@0003

And besides, if you weren't around,

One day, you will surpass me.@0003@000BHuh? Really? Do you mean that, Teacher?@0003@0009It all hinges on your own efforts.@0003@000B@0080@000D@000B@0017I won't let you down!@0003@0017@0009Only those who choose magic can handle it.

Be confident. You have a rare gift that
others can never duplicate.@0003@000BTeacher@0016...@0016@0003
@0017If you really mean that, then there's
no way I'm going to let you die.@0003@0017@0009Ewan@0016...@0016@0003@000B@0017I'll be at your side protecting you.@0003

I bet you're a regular troublemaker.@0003
So, what were you so lost in thought
over? You having any problems?@0003@0009Nope, nothing.
I don't have any problems.@0003
I was thinking of something interesting.
You want to hear about it?@0003@000CSure. Tell me everything.@0003@0009Well, I was thinking of how much fun it
would be if I could do something@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017Uh-huh.@0003@0017@0009Some battlegrounds are full of plants and
stuff, but others are dreary and dead.@0003@000CYeah.@0003@0009If a place like that were suddenly filled
with beautiful colors, it'd be neat, right?@0003
Like if it could suddenly become
a flower garden?@0003@000C@0017Ho ho, a battleground becoming a
lovely flower garden?@0003
@0017Aye, that would be nice. It would help
heal the hearts and minds of the soldiers.@0003
But how would you do it? Do you have some
sort of magical powers or something?@0003@0009Yeah, I do, but I've decided that
wouldn't be the best way.@0003
If I did that, people would be more impressed
by the magic than by the flowers.@0003
I think it would be better to make it
something that anyone could do and enjoy.@0003@000C@0017Oh@0016...@0016@0003
It's all too difficult for me to follow,

people would really enjoy it.@0003@0009Ha ha@0016... @0016I haven't really thought
much about how I would do it.@0003

would be, that's all.@0003@000CGwah ha ha! That's fine. That's what

@0017@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0123@000CHo, laddie.@0003@0009Uncle Dozla!@0003@000CSo, you're in high spirits today?@0003@0009Yep! I'm always in high spirits.
How about you, Uncle?@0003@000COh, I'm doing as well as can be
expected. I'm a bit tired, actually.@0003
I'm a bit closer to the ground than everyone
else, so my legs tire easily. Gwah ha!@0003
It would be nice if there were an easier
way to move around, wouldn't it?@0003@0009Oh, that reminds me.
I've been thinking of something.@0003
Do you want to hear about it?@0003@000C@0017What's this? Have you come up with
yet another fabulous idea?@0003@0017@0009Yep!@0003@000CWell, what is it?@0003@0009Coaches! You're familiar
with coaches, right?@0003@000CUh-huh.@0003@0009And we've got a coach in our convoy
because it can carry people and supplies.@0003@000CYeah, they're useful enough.@0003
They're nice if you're traveling far with 
wounded men, children, and whatnot.@0003
@0017But without roads, they're almost useless,
and forget about dense forests.@0003
Oh, and they can be quite vulnerable in
a battle. Not very useful at all, really.@0003@0017@0009Exactly! So I was thinking about coaches
that could travel in the air@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0017What's that?@0003@0002
Are you talking about using
pegasus knights?@0003@0017@0009That's what I was thinking at first. But
you know, that probably wouldn't work.@0003
I mean, a pegasus can get mighty picky
about who it lets ride him, right?@0003
I haven't really thought about how to
actually make a flying coach, but@0016...@0016@0003
But wouldn't it be amazing if one
really existed?@0003
It would be fast, and all that stuff like
bad roads and forests wouldn't matter!@0003@000C@0017Ho ho ho ho!@0003@0017@0009And even if people lived far apart, they
could visit one another quickly!@0003
What do you think?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha! It's fantastic! And it
would be useful, that's for sure!@0003
Sounds like fun, too. I'd sure love
to ride about in a flying coach.@0003
Think about it@0016--@0016the land spread out below,
glittering dawn skies@0016...@0016and the wind!@0003
Ah, it all sounds like a dream.@0003@0009I hope it becomes reality someday.@0003@000CMe, too.@0003
I like the way your mind works,
laddie. Let's talk more later.@0003@0009Yep!@0003
# 0x0D33
@0017@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0123@0009Ah, Uncle Dozla.@0003
Listen to this, will you? I've
been thinking about something new.@0003@000COoh, I can hardly wait.@0003@0009Imagine people far away from each
other talking.@0003@000C@0017Far away? You mean, like, if you
and I were maybe@0016...@0016100 paces apart?@0003@0017@0009Nope. Farther than that.@0003@000C@0017All right, 1,000 paces!@0003@0017@0009Not even close. Farther still!@0003@000C@001710,000 paces? You must be kidding.@0003@0017@0009No, I'm not. And even farther than
that! For example@0016...@0016@0003
What if one person were in Frelia,
and the other person were in Rausten?@0003@000C@0017What?!@0003@0017@0009That's right! Anyone you could
think of, you could talk to.@0003
I read about magical devices that
could do the same thing, but@0016...@0016@0003
Wouldn't it be better if anyone
could do it, and not just mages?@0003@000C@0017Impressive! I think I see it@0016...@0016@0003
People could send and receive important
messages instantly, is that it?@0003@0017@0009No, even better than that!@0003
I'm not talking about just sending
messages back and forth.@0003
I mean like if they could talk,
just like you and I are now!@0003
We wouldn't need messengers at
all! It would all happen instantly!@0003@000C@0017I just can't wrap my head around this
one, laddie. It's too much for me.@0003@0017@0009Great, isn't it?@0003
You could contact your people in
Rausten from anywhere, at any time!@0003@000C@0017My, oh my@0016... @0016You've got quite
an imagination, don't you?@0003
The things you come up with always
surprise me, laddie.@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha.@0003
I used to get in trouble for always
thinking up these outlandish things.@0003@000CGwah ha ha! That's a shame, laddie.@0003
After all, I'm sure a lot of the things
we have now seemed outlandish once.@0003
If nobody dreamed, nothing new would
ever be created, would it?@0003@0009@0017Uncle Dozla@0016...@0016@0003
@0017You always have time to listen to my
ideas, Uncle. It makes me really happy.@0003@000C@0017It's always worth the time to listen to
you youngsters and your ideas.@0003
It's sad, but I know people who are so
busy that they've no time to spare.@0003
@0017But me, I've got time. As you know,
I'm one of Princess L'Arachel's men.@0003
I'm not the brightest fellow around, so
she doesn't give me a lot to do.@0003
But that gives me lots of free time, and
I'm always happy to spend it with you.@0003@0009Thank you. I think you're
the best, Uncle Dozla!@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha! What a nice thing to say.
And I think you're the best, laddie.@0003
I think when you're fully grown, you're
going to be a great and interesting man.@0003@0009Do you really think so?@0003@000CI do. It's that sparkle in
your eyes that convinces me.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Yahoo! Ha ha ha.@0003@000CI'm looking forward to the day when I see
one of your ideas made reality.@0003@0009And that day will surely come.@0003
It's weird@0016...@0016but there are times when
I can almost picture a world like that.@0003@000CGwah ha ha!
Now that would be something.@0003
I'll have to make sure I live
long enough to see it.@0003@0009Yep! And you'll have to
stay my friend, too!@0003@000CWell, of course!@0003
# 0x0D34
@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0121@000C@0017Hey!@0006
What's your name?@0003@0017@0009Me?
I'm Amelia.@0003@000C@0017Ah. Amelia@0016...@0016
My name's Ewan. Hi!@0003@0017@0017@0009Hi, Ewan. It's nice
to meet you.@0003
So, are you fighting
with us?@0003@000CYep, I am.
I'm a mage.@0003@0009@0017Really?@0003
@0017You look like you're only
about my age. That's neat.@0003@000CHa ha! Ah, I'm nothing special
compared to my teacher.@0003
You want to see some magic?@0003@0009@0017H-here? Now? But@0016...@0016
isn't that dangerous?@0003@0017@000COh, don't worry. Magic isn't
just for combat. For example@0016...@0016@0003
Voila! It can do stuff like this!@0003@0009Wow@0016...@0016
They're so pretty!@0003
All those little lights,
spinning around together@0016...@0016@0003
Is this really magic?@0003@000CThis?@0004
This is magic used to make girls happy.@0003@0009@0017Hm?@0005 Ah!
@0017Oh, Ewan, stop teasing.@0003@000CHa ha ha.@0003@0009Ha ha.@0003@000CYou should show me how good you
are with your lance sometime.@0003@0009@0017Huh? Um, all right. But@0016...@0016
I'm sure you'd be bored.@0003@0017@000CThat's not true.@0003
And even if it were, it's simply
a matter of how you make it fun.@0003@0009@0017How you@0016...@0016make it fun?@0003@0017@000CUh-huh.
Like this war, for example.@0003
Well, Amelia, I'll
see you later!@0003@000C@0011@0009@0017Hey!@0003
@0016......@0016@0005
Ewan sure moves at his own pace@0016...@0016@0003@0002
How you make it fun? Hmm@0016...@0016@0003
@0017That seems like a good rule to
live by, when you think about it.@0003
# 0x0D35
@0009@0010@0119@0009Ah@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@000F@0017@000DWhew. This looks like a
good place to take a break.@0003@0006@000E@0010@0121@000E@0080@000B@0009@0016...!@0016@0005
@0016......@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@000D@0006@000BBoo!@0003@000D@0080@000F@000D@0017AHHHH!@0003@0017@000D@0011@000B@0011@0007@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0119@0009Ha ha ha!
Amelia, it's me.@0003@000C@0017Ah!@0004
Ewan?@0003
Why did you do that? I thought
you were one of the enemy!@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha. We talked about this,
remember? How you make it fun?@0003
I just wanted to make our meeting
here a little more fun.@0003@000C@0017Well, it wasn't fun
for me at all.@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha.@0003
Oh, yeah, Amelia?@0003
Do you remember you promised to
show me your lance work?@0003@000C@0017Um@0016...@0016yeah.
I remember.@0003
@0017Well, all right. Here.
Watch closely.@0003@0009Oh, I will.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000D@000B@0016......@0016@0003
@000B@0080@000D@000BHA!
@0016...@0016YAH!@0003@0009@0017That's good.@0003@0017@000B@0080@000F@000DAH!@0003
@000D@0080@000F@000D@0016...@0016WAH!@0003@0009Neat.@0003@000D@0080@000E@000C@0016......@0016@0003
@000C@0080@000E@000C@0016...@0016YAAAH!!@0003@0009@0017That was great!@0003@0017@000CThanks.@0003@0009@0017You're good, Amelia. You're as good
as any of the other knights.@0003@0017@0017@000CDo you mean that?
@0017Whew@0016...@0016@0003
@0017To be honest, I have been practicing
even harder lately.@0003
But it was all worth it to hear you
say that. Thanks.@0003@0009Really? No, thank you.
I like your outfit, too.@0003@000C@0017Huh?@0003
Oh, I get it.@0003@0002
You're teasing me again,
aren't you, Ewan?@0003
What was it, again?
Making things fun?@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha. No, that's not
at all what I was doing.@0003@000C@0017Hmm@0016...@0016
I'm not sure I should believe you.@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha.@0003
Princess Eirika has a similar
outfit. Is that a popular style?@0003@000C@0017Um@0016...@0016I don't know.@0003
@0017But it's easy to move in, so@0016...@0016@0003@0009I see. I think it's cute. Especially
that stain right there.@0003@000C@0017Oh@0016...@0016
Ewan, you're such a twit!@0003@0017@0009Ha ha ha.@0003
# 0x0D36
@0017@0009@0010@0121@000C@0010@0119@0009Amelia, have you traveled much?@0003@000CTravel?@0003@0002
@0017Hm, let's see@0016...@0016@0003
I went from Silva to the
capital on my own once.@0003
Now that I think about it, I'd
never left Grado until now.@0003@0017@0009Oh, really?@0003
My teacher@0016--@0016he's the great
sage Saleh from Caer Pelyn@0016--@0016@0003
took me out on a training
journey for many months once.@0003@000CWhere did you go?@0003@0009Lots of different places across Magvel.@0003
We went to Renais, Frelia, Rausten, and
Jehanna. Oh, and we went to Grado, too.@0003@000CWow, that sounds great.@0003@0009Yeah, it was a lot of fun! There
were so many new things to see.@0003
Say, Amelia, I just had an idea@0016...@0016@0003@000CWhat is it?@0003@0009When this war is over and we're all at peace,
why don't you and I take a trip together?@0003@000C@0017Huh? Just the two of us?@0003@0017@0009Sure, why not? Does
the idea bother you?@0003@000C@0017No, it's just@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009There's so much I want
to show you, Amelia.@0003
How the dark green forests refract the
morning sun into a million burning emeralds.@0003
The melancholy spectacle of the sun sinking 
slowly beyond an endless horizon.@0003
The wind gently coercing vast fields of
wheat to dance, heroic mountain peaks@0016...@0016@0003
Oh, and the gorgeous flower beds that
fill your vision with brilliant colors!@0003
There are so very many spectacular
places in the world.@0003
I want to see all of them again@0016...@0016but
this time I want to see them with you.@0003
When you see them, you'll really understand
how wonderful it is to be alive.@0003
The feeling will fill your heart and
make you want to sing with joy!@0003@000C@0017That's so@0016...@0016eloquent, Ewan.@0003
@0016......@0016@0003
@0017But I understand what you're
trying to say, and yes. Let's go!@0003
I want to see all of it and more!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Great!
Then it's settled.@0003
You know what? This gives us something to
look forward to while this war goes on.@0003
Just thinking about it makes my heart
beat faster.@0003@000CHa ha.@0003
You know, Ewan, being around you fills
me with so much energy.@0003@0009And I'm happy when you're around, too.@0003@000CI'm looking forward to our trip.@0003
It's one more reason for us to work
quickly to put an end to this war.@0003@0009Yeah, let's do what we can, because
we're definitely taking that trip!@0003
# 0x0D37
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0123@0009@0080@000B@0009Oh, I cannot believe it.@0003
There is something very
wrong with this world.@0003@000CHm?! What is it? What's
happened, Princess L'Arachel?@0003@0009Hello, Dozla.
Listen to this.@0003
The other day, I paid a visit
to a nearby village.@0003
I found something inconceivable there.@0003
Not one of them had ever heard of the
beautiful banisher of darkness before.@0003@000CWhat?!@0003
Even with your anonymous campaign
to rid the world of monstrosities?@0003
I cannot fathom how those people
could be so uninformed!@0003@0009Last night, I was so distraught that I
quite nearly drowned my pillow in tears.@0003
This will never do, Dozla.@0003
I must be more famous. The entire
world must know of my legend.@0003
The troubadours must be made to
sing my praises far and wide.@0003@000CAnd I'm sure they will!@0003@0009The five heroes who banished evil@0016...@0016@0003
My own sacred ancestor@0016...@0016@0003
Oh, to be like them@0016... @0016I so long
to be praised by the masses, too.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Gwah ha ha!
And you shall be, Princess!@0003@0017@0009But I get the feeling that we're going
to have to change our methodology.@0003
Appealing to the common people is of
the utmost importance.@0003
First and foremost, we need a plan of
action. A means to win their hearts.@0003
Please, Dozla, I want you to
think of something, too.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Gwah ha ha!
Leave it to your trusted Dozla!@0003@0017
# 0x0D38
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0123@0009Dozla, have you thought
of any good plans?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Gwah ha ha! Prepare yourself
for joy, Princess L'Arachel!@0003
I, Dozla, have come up with a
plan of masterpiece proportions!@0003@0017@0009@0017Oh! That is good news!@0003
Don't keep me waiting, Dozla.
Let me hear it.@0003@0017@000C@0017Gwah ha! Here goes!@0003
@0017All of the heroes from the dawn of
time had two names, did they not?@0003
So what you need, Princess, is another
name. Something with oomph!@0003@0009@0017Oh, Dozla! What a splendid idea!@0003
An alias would make it easier for
the people to remember me.@0003
Very well, Dozla, we must come up
with a wonderful epithet for me.@0003@0017@000CHmm@0016...@0016@0003@0002
@0004Aha!@0003
@0017It's come to me, Princess L'Arachel!@0003
How do you like the sound of the
green-haired battle princess?@0003@0017@0009Um, no.@0003
I want something with more force.
Something with more@0016...@0016impact.@0003@0002
@0005@0017I've got it!@0003
What do you think of the beautiful
princess of peerless beauty?!@0003@0017@0017@000COh! It's fantastic!@0003
You're amazing, Princess L'Arachel!
What a splendid nickname!@0003@0009Of course it is.@0003
L'Arachel, the beautiful princess of
peerless beauty!@0003
It has such a nice ring to it. Just
rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha!@0003@0009@0017What we do now is vital
to our success, Dozla.@0003
It wouldn't do for me to ride about
calling myself by my own nickname.@0003
It must be spread about in a
nonchalant manner.@0003
Dozla, starting now, I want you to refer
to me exclusively by my epithet,@0003
L'Arachel, the beautiful princess of peerless
beauty, when you're among the soldiers.@0003
And don't forget to slip it into
everyday conversation, too.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha!
Understood, Princess L'Arachel!@0003
# 0x0D39
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0123@0009How is it progressing, Dozla?@0003
Is it working?@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Gwah ha ha!
You will be pleased, Princess L'Arachel!@0003
Just recently I saw a group of
villagers together gossiping.@0003
They'd seen a suspicious young woman in
fantastic garb riding around at night.@0003
And they called that enigmatic woman the
beautiful princess of peerless beauty!@0003@0017@0017@0009Yes! They were most certainly
talking about me then.@0003
At last, I am becoming known amongst
the people of the land.@0003
Those three long trips I took around
the area were worth the trouble.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha!
You're so right, Princess L'Arachel!@0003
There can be no doubt that the
villagers were appropriately impressed.@0003@0009@0017Yet I find it passing strange.@0003
How is it that no one has
appeared to imitate me?@0003
The beautiful banisher of darkness
was well enough known, after all.@0003
It's only natural that someone somewhere
would have aspired to be like me.@0003
The fact that no imitators have appeared
has me very worried, I must say.@0003@0017@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha!
How right you are!@0003
But you are peerless, Princess L'Arachel,
as your nickname says!@0003
It would be impossible for anyone to
claim your beauty as her own!@0003@0009@0017Well, that is true. It certainly was
not easy for me, after all.@0003@0002
@0017Yet now, I am destined to be
remembered in the future as a hero.@0003
I wonder how my legend will be passed on
after I leave this earth.@0003
I am so looking forward to it.@0003
The beautiful princess of peerless
beauty, L'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003
Ah@0016... @0016How enchanting.@0003
Already, I weep for the world that
will one day be robbed of my beauty.@0003@000CGwah ha ha!@0003@0009I must do something spectacular this
battle to ensure my name is remembered.@0003
Let's go, Dozla.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CGwah ha ha! Ready as ever,
Princess L'Arachel!@0003

@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0124@0009Just a moment, Rennac.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CYipes!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009And what do you
mean, yipes?@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009Is meeting me honestly such
an unpleasant affair?@0003@000CIt's just that my job becomes difficult
when noisy people like you are about.@0003@0009Noisy? How rude! Couldn't you have
said showy? Or flamboyant, perhaps!?@0003@000CBut that would be lying.
You really are noisy.@0003
Do you even realize that
you were yelling just now?@0003@0009Yell? Me!? Why, I never!
You've gone too far!@0003
Rennac, you would do well to remember that
your number-one priority is guarding me.@0003@000CThat's not the case anymore.@0003
These people respect my abilities
and value my skills.@0003@0009Very well, I grant that you've made
yourself useful out here.@0003
However, sir, you know nothing about
how to treat a lady!@0003
You would do well to refine yourself.@0003@000CNow, who's being rude? I happen
to be quite the gentleman.@0003
For instance, I have some small
renown as a fabulous dancer.@0003@0009You? A dancer? I wonder if you're
not merely flattering yourself@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CYou don't think I can dance? Then test
me! You'll see how well I can dance!@0003
Come on, get down off your horse.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Me? Dance with you?@0003
Do you believe I would
dance with a commoner?@0003
Please, our stations would
never permit it.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CIt's not a matter of station. If you
permit us to dance, you would see.@0003
Unless@0016... @0016Wait a minute, maybe
YOU'RE the one who can't dance!@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Rennac! You overstep yourself!@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009All right! If you dare speak such
blasphemies, then I have no choice!@0003
When next we meet, I will test your
vainglorious boast myself!@0003@0002
But remember, my dancing with one
such as you is a rare occasion.@0003
Because it will be so special, I
expect you to be most grateful.@0003
Got it!?@0003@000CYeah, yeah.
I get it.@0003@0009Very well. I suggest you devote yourself
to practicing while you've the time.@0003@000CNow, you're the one who's gone too far!
I'm going to make you eat your words.@0003
# 0x0D3B
@000C@0010@0124@0009@0010@0122@001C@0009So@0016...@0016Rennac. We finally meet again.@0003
Do you remember our agreement?@0003@000CPrincess L'Arachel! Well,
of course I remember, but@0016...@0016@0003
Surely, this isn't the place for
a, er, dance off, is it?@0003@0009Stop your complaining!@0003
You will make yourself available
at MY leisure, sir.@0003
Now then, shall we dance?@0003@000CAre you serious?!@0003
In THIS place? It's preposterous!
It's ridiculous@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000D@000C@0080@000F@000BVery well, let us begin.@0003@000DYes, yes, I know what happens
next. Oh, bother@0016...@0016@0003@000B1@0016...@00162@0016...@00163@0016...@0016@0003@0015@000B@0080@000D@000B@0080@000E@000C@0080@000E@000C@0080@000D@000D@0080@000F@000D@0080@000E@000BSlow@0016...@0016slow@0016...@0016

I imagined you'd be.@0003@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
My father was a merchant. We found
ourselves invited to many balls.@0003
It was my job to dance with the wives
and daughters of his associates.@0003
I found that I had a taste for it, and
with practice, I improved my skill.@0003@0017@0009Is that so? I see@0016... @0016It's not
fair you kept that secret.@0003
Your dance skills were quite adequate.@0003
Your treatment of ladies, however, is
still sorely lacking. Next@0016...@0016@0003@000CUh-oh.@0005
I really have no time to chat.@0003
I must be going.
Farewell.@0003@000C@0011@0009@0080@000B@0009W-wait a minute, Rennac!@0006
Ooh!@0003
@0016......@0016@0003
I don't know why, but@0016...@0016
I'm quite vexed@0016...@0016@0003
# 0x0D3C
@0009@0010@0122@000C@0010@0124@000C@0016...@0016Sigh@0016...@0016@0003@0009Don't you know that it's rude to
sigh when you see someone, Rennac?@0003
You may be a fair dancer, but your
smooth moves belie your gruff manners.@0003
You should learn from me. If you were
truly happy, you would not sigh so.@0003
Tell me, Rennac, what is it that
makes you happy?@0003@000CMakes me happy?@0003
Let me see@0016...@0016
Uh@0016...@0016@0003
I've never really thought about it.
If pressed, I'd have to say gold.@0003@0009Gold, did you say?@0003
So if you had gold, you would
be happy. Is that it?@0003@000CWell, if you have enough gold, you
can buy whatever you desire.@0003
Mercenaries work so that they can
get paid. It's why they fight.@0003
Knights fight because they have
sworn oaths, but there is more@0016...@0016@0003
They've been promised a certain social
status by fulfilling their oaths.@0003@0009So, by getting what you desire,
you can be happy? Is that it?@0003@000CWhat do you mean?@0003@0009Rather than lament over what you do not
possess, you should treasure what you do.@0003
That's a very important lesson to learn,
don't you think?@0003
Isn't that the road to true happiness?@0003@000CPrincess L'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003
I know you mean well when
you say things like that.@0003
But coming from someone who has
everything, it means very little.@0003@0009This has nothing to do with
my station in life.@0003
And as for you, what need have you
of money or fame? You have me!@0003
Merely serving me must be the
greatest pleasure man can know.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CSo, that's what this is about, is it?@0003@0009Your employer is sweet and lovely.@0003
That is something most people
dream of having.@0003
@0017Surely you cannot aspire to
happiness greater than this.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0003
I've always wondered, Princess,
how your ego grew so large.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009You complain far too much!@0003
Come, Rennac. It's time to go.
Follow me, and try not to lag.@0003@0009@0011@000CAh, Princess L'Arachel!@0005
@0016...@0016Perfect@0016...@0016@0003
True happiness? Is this really
what happiness feels like?@0003

You there, lassie.
Are you lost?@0003@000CI@0016...@0016
I'm not lost.@0003
I'm traveling with Ephraim.
I'm his@0016...@0016friend.@0003@0009Oho! In that case, you and I
are allies, are we not?@0003
My name's Dozla. It's
an honor to meet you!@0003@000CUh-huh@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Gwah ha ha! You're a
quiet lassie, aren't you?@0003
And you're so tiny, too.@0003
Seeing you takes me back to the days
when Princess L'Arachel was a child.@0003
Tell me, lassie, how old are you?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016@0003
It's impolite to ask a woman her
age. That's what Ephraim says.@0003
I think you're being rude.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Gwah ha ha!
Aren't you the sassy one!@0003
You're still young. I don't think you
need to worry about age just yet.@0003@0017@000CAnd how old are you?@0003@0009@0017Me? I'm all of forty-seven
years old.@0003@0017@000CAnd I am@0016...@0016@0003
1,200 years old. Roughly.@0003@0009Huh?@0003
@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Gwah ha ha!
Stop teasing me, lassie!@0003
You don't have to be shy.
Just tell me how old you are.@0003@0017@000CI did. And I said I'm
1,200@0016... @0016Roughly.@0003

Do you know where I might
find Princess L'Arachel?@0003@0017@000C@0016...@0016I do not.@0003
But that's not important.
Where is Ephraim?@0003@0009@0017If it's Prince Ephraim you're after,
just follow the sounds of combat!@0003
There's no better way to motivate your
troops than to stand by their side!@0003@0017@000CThat L'Arachel person is probably
with Ephraim.@0003
I saw her next to him speaking to
him on quite familiar terms.@0003
For some reason, it made
my chest feel@0016...@0016funny.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009@0017Gwah ha ha!
It must be love!@0003@0017@000CLove?@0003

that life serves up, and I know love.@0003

I shouldn't have?@0003
I-I'm sorry, lassie.
Please don't cry@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0080@001D@000CI'm not crying@0016...@0016@0003

What do I do?@0003
Wait. Just think. I must have run
across something like this before.@0003
When Princess L'Arachel was a babe,
and she would begin to cry@0016...@0016@0003
She would tug on my beard! That
would always make her happy.@0003
C'mon, lassie, grab a handful of my
beard and give it a good, strong yank!@0003@000C@0080@001C@000C@0016......@0016@0003
You are strange, Dozla.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009What?@0003@000CBut you were worried about me.
That makes me happy.@0003

Why has fate chosen to
treat me so cruelly?@0003@000CAh, Rennac.@0003
You look so pleased to have been
reunited with Princess L'Arachel.@0003
I'm glad we're all in one piece!@0003@0009You haven't changed, Dozla. Your ability to
misread people still ruins all conversation.@0003
I am lamenting, old man! I am raging
against my horrible misfortune!@0003
You're a vassal sworn to serve Princess
L'Arachel. You're supposed to be here.@0003
I, however, am not. I'm temporary. Got it?
I'm an employee! I am NOT a vassal!@0003@000C@0080@000E@000C@0017Gwah ha ha! You're just as interesting as
ever. You're still hard to follow, but@0016...@0016@0003@0017@0009This is not a conversation for you to
enjoy, and it's not at all hard to follow!@0003
It's not that I don't enjoy being in this
army, but traveling with her again@0016...@0016@0003
I mean, I haven't even been properly
paid for the last job.@0003@000COh, so it's about money, is it? In
that case, you've no worries, Rennac.@0003
All you have to do is see Princess
L'Arachel safely back to Rausten.@0003
Once that's done, His Majesty will pay
you any amount you desire.@0003@0009That's what I heard the last time, but do
you have any idea how much I desire?@0003
When he hears it, His Majesty
may very well explode!@0003@000CHmm, so about 1,000 gold pieces?@0003@0009Huh? You can't even buy a
proper blade for that price!@0003@000CWhat, 5,000 then?@0003@0009You've got the wrong number
of zeroes, old man.@0003@000COh, my apologies.
So you want 500 gold, eh?@0003@0009No! That's smaller! It cannot get smaller!
I want more! It's 50,000! 50,000 gold!@0003
And I'll bend 50,000 ears to get it
if I have to! Someone must listen!@0003@000COh, right. I understand!
You need 50,000 ears, is that it?@0003
Very well, when we return to Rausten
we'll get 50,000 people together!@0003
Wait@0016...@0016that's 100,000 ears. Well anyway,
you'll have all the ears you need!@0003@0009It's just a figure of speech, old
man. Bah! I was a fool to complain.@0003

can't win battles if you've no hope!@0003@0009This journey has taught me the hollowness
and the transience of life's pleasures.@0003
Ah, to what end do we toil on this
unforgiving earth? Why do we live?@0003@000CWhy do we live? Well, if you're not
alive, then you're dead, and@0016...@0016@0003
Er@0016...@0016if you're dead, then you
can't eat, and@0016...@0016@0003
What was I saying?@0005
I think I must be getting hungry.@0003
@0017I wonder what's for dinner.
My belly's a-rumbling!@0003@0017@0009It must be nice to have no worries
other than what to eat, old man.@0003
And not just you, either.@0003
I'm sure that a certain young lady
has nothing to worry about, either.@0003@000CWhat's that?
Do you mean Princess L'Arachel?@0003
@0017That girl believes the world will turn
out just as she envisions it.@0003
I doubt if the word worry even has
any meaning to her in the first place.@0003@0017@0009What a completely envious
position to be in.@0003
I may not look it now, but I'm the
son of a wealthy Carcino merchant.@0003
I believed that you could move the
world if you but had the gold.@0003
Money was everything, and with money,
nothing was beyond my reach!@0003
I adored money! I loved money! You see?@0003@000C@0017What good fortune for you that your
father was a thriving merchant.@0003@0017@0009That's just it@0016... @0016There are people who can
do anything without any money at all@0016...@0016@0003
She's overbearing and egotistical, yet she
has us all jumping through hoops.@0003
That's a skill normal people
don't possess.@0003@000C@0017That's Princess L'Arachel!
She makes the impossible possible!@0003
You're with her because she made a
deep impression on you, too, right?@0003@0017@0009A deep impression? It's more like I'm in
shock, and my brain's been frozen.@0003@000C@0080@000E@000CWhat? Your brain's frozen? That'll never
do! Did you forget to wear a hat?@0003@0015@000C@0080@000D@000BLet me at it. I'll thaw it out.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009@0080@000A@0008Knock it off! I was speaking figuratively!
You know? As in not literally?@0003
You're too strong to joke around
like that! Stop it!@0003@000B@0080@000D@000B@0017Gwah ha ha!
Just teasing you!@0003@0017@0008Sigh@0016...@0016
What a pair the two of you make@0016...@0016@0003
You know, you're the only one who can
keep up with Princess L'Arachel, old man.@0003
# 0x0D42
@0009@0010@0123@000C@0010@0124@0009You know, Rennac. I was just
thinking about something.@0003
These battles are tough on an
old man like me.@0003
I might not make it through
to see the end of this.@0003@000CWhere did that come from?
It better not be an omen.@0003@0009I want to see Princess L'Arachel
in her wedding dress one day.@0003
That's my one wish in life:
to see her happily wed.@0003@000CTelling me about it isn't
going to make it happen.@0003
Trying to find a worthy prince who's
willing to take Princess L'Arachel?@0003
That's no easy task to accomplish.@0003@0009If I end up food for the crows, if
I cannot escort the princess home,@0003
I want you to take care of her for me.@0003@000CWhat? Why? No, I won't do it.
You can't make me! Sorry, but NO!@0003
You're the vassal, old man. I'm nothing
more than an escort, a thief.@0003
When this war's over, I'm going to collect
my pay and then disappear. You got it?@0003
Once Princess L'Arachel settles down,
she'll probably never leave Rausten again.@0003
It's got nothing to do with me.@0003@0009That's cold, Rennac@0016...@0016@0003
I'm disappointed. I'm sure she'll be so
lovely. Princess L'Arachel, the bride@0016...@0016@0003@0015@0009@0080@001D@0009If I gently close my eyes, I can envision
what a glorious spectacle it will be.@0003@000CIf all you need is someone to listen,
I'll play along. What kind of spectacle?@0003@000C@0080@001D@0009The loving couple exchanging their sacred
vows. The joyous citizens of Rausten!@0003@000C@0017Congratulations, Princess L'Arachel!
Our condolences, Prince.@0003@0017@0009The newlyweds will smile and wave as the
royal coach passes through the crowds.@0003
Can you see the flowers? The silver and gold
inlay and the gems glittering in the sun?@0003@000C@0080@000D@000B@0080@001C@000B@0017What? They have a gem-encrusted coach?
Now that's something I must see.@0003
I'll be on the street, waving a flag, then
I'll race up and offer my congratulations!@0003@0017@0017@0009@0080@001C@0009@0080@000C@000AWould you really?
That's happy news.@0003
Princess L'Arachel will be so surprised
to see you running after them!@0003@000BYeah, and then she'll look at me
with that smug face and say,@0003
Oh, Rennac. Whatever are you
doing here?@0003
Come along! Fall in and follow us.@0003@000AAnd then Princess L'Arachel will set out
across the continent on her honeymoon@0016...@0016@0003
I've got it! You'll be her guard on her
honeymoon! Fantastic! That's wonderful!@0003@000B@0017N-no! You're getting carried away!@0003@0017@000ANow you're a true vassal to Princess
L'Arachel, body and soul. Gwah ha ha!@0003@000B@0017I've got a terrible feeling I'll never
get away from Princess L'Arachel@0016...@0016@0003@0017

@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0125@000CCormag@0016...@0016@0003@0009Sir Duessel.@0003@000CAre you well?@0003@0009I am as you see me.
Fine in every respect.@0003@000CI'm not talking about your flesh.
It's your heart I'm worried for.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CI'm here because I made the decision for
myself to leave Grado.@0003
Luckily for me, one of the leaders here
is an old acquaintance of mine.@0003
I'm not saying my heart is at ease, but
I have found something to believe in.@0003
Something to fight for.
And yet, you@0016...@0016@0003@0009I, too, made a choice to be here.
There's no need for your concern.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009I believe in myself. Therefore it
matters not where I am.@0003
So no matter where I go or what I do,
I'm sure my brother would understand.@0003@000CCormag.@0003@0009And besides, General Duessel, you're
here in this army with me.@0003
There's no shame in fighting alongside
the man once known as Obsidian.@0003@000CMm.@0003
Cormag, let us emerge victorious from this
war, for the things we both believe in.@0003@0009Yes.@0003
# 0x0D44
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0113@000CSir Duessel.@0003@0009Well met, Cormag.
I'm impressed by your skills.@0003@000CThey're still far below
yours, General Duessel.@0003
By the way, I have a favor I've
been meaning to ask of you.@0003@0009What is it? Please tell me.@0003@000CYour stories tell of a small lance you
carry like a treasure. May I see it?@0003@0009Stories, you say? Am I the subject
of stories now? Interesting.@0003
Here is the lance you're talking about.
Examine it at your leisure.@0003@000CIt@0016... @0016It really is@0016...@0016
It's a Gavaleus@0016...@0016@0003@0009Oh! You've heard of Gavaleus, have you?@0003
You must know quite a bit about the
crafting of weapons.@0003
This is one of Gavaleus's final works.@0003
I have quite a collection of weapons, but
this is among the most beautiful of them.@0003
While it can be used in battle, I would
never dull its shine with blood or dirt.@0003
If I ever use this lance, I vow that it
will be only in my own final hour.@0003@000CIt shines as though it could light
up the soul of its wielder.@0003
You're right. I would hesitate to
stain its beauty with blood, too.@0003@0009@0017Ah, so you grasp what I mean?@0017
Cormag, you have a discerning eye.@0003@000C@0017Thank you.@0003
And yet, I know that I will never
be your equal, General Duessel.@0003@0017@0009Come, now.@0003
You know, your brother asked to
see this lance once as well.@0003@000CMy brother?@0003@0009Yes.@0003
You two are so alike. His comments
mirror your own almost exactly.@0003@000CIs that so?@0003@0009For warriors, our weapons are our lives.
@0017I'm glad to know you understand that.@0003
Someday, you'll be a splendid wyvern
knight to equal your brother.@0003@0017
# 0x0D45
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0113@0009Cormag@0016...@0016
I've something I want to show you.@0003
Here it is. This lance.
What do you think of it?@0003@000CMy!@0005 It has such power! It
sends chills down my spine@0016...@0016@0003
I am not nearly strong enough to
wield a weapon such as this.@0003@0009Hm, you think so? Merely holding this
lance makes me tremble with dread.@0003
Not overly so, but enough to stop
me from wielding it in combat.@0003
This lance@0016... @0016It can drive its
wielder to madness.@0003@000CMadness, you say?@0003@0009Yes, Cormag. It's a magic weapon of dark
design that's been in my family for ages.@0003
Legend states that the leader of our house
must always carry it, but never use it.@0003
We are prohibited from wielding it until such
a time as madness itself rules the day.@0003
It's part of my legacy, and yet@0016...@0016I@0016...@0016
I made a grave error@0016...@0016@0003
I allowed Valter to use this lance.@0003@000CYou let Valter@0016--@0016@0003@0009Yes@0016...@0016
@0016...@0016We were in the middle of a battle.@0003
Valter had broken his lance, and when I
wasn't looking he somehow took this one.@0003
From that moment, he was changed@0016...@0016
He killed everyone@0016--@0016even retreating men.@0003
I took the lance from him when I realized
what had happened, but it was too late.@0003
Madness had awakened within Valter and
was coursing through his body.@0003
From then on, he hungered only for battle
and for blood@0016...@0016@0003
It's not as though Valter was a gentle lamb
before, but now his appetite for violence@0003
increased many times over. It's all
because of this cursed lance.@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
That odd light playing around the point@0016...@0016
I thought it looked familiar.@0003
It was Valter@0016... @0016It's the same light Valter
had in his eyes on the battlefield.@0003
Valter's insane because of this lance.
@0016......@0016@0003
Sir Duessel, if it please you, would you
let me have this lance?@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009What? You?
B-but@0016...@0016@0003@000CAre you worried that I will
end up like Valter?@0003@0009N-no@0016...@0016
@0016......@0016@0003@000CThis lance@0016--@0016someone needs to master it.
It's just a feeling I have.@0003
A weapon is only as good or evil as
the man who wields it.@0003
In the hands of someone just, it can
be a righteous weapon.@0003
In the hands of the wicked, it's a
danger to all.@0003
Believe me, I have not been seduced
by this lance.@0003
I merely want to see it used for the
purpose for which it was forged.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003
I understand you, Cormag.
I'm going to let you have it.@0003
I have no son. I had not yet decided
to whom I should pass on this legacy.@0003
Now I see that leaving it to someone
whom I trust and believe in is best.@0003
As with me, your admiration of weapons
is balanced by a healthy respect.@0003
You also have a good eye, and you
possess tremendous strength.@0003
The day you are able to wield this lance
may not be far off at all.@0003
If the madness in this lance can be tamed,
it may very well be a weapon without equal.@0003
@0016...@0016I never had the courage to wield it, but
I would love to see it used righteously.@0003
@0016...@0016I am entrusting it to you.
I hope you will use it one day.@0003@000CI accept your gift, Sir Duessel.@0003@0002
I would receive it once this battle is
finished and our hearts are calmer.@0003
If I were to take it in the heat of
battle, I might become Valter the second.@0003
It is a possibility that I cannot dismiss.@0003@0009Yes, I see.
Cormag@0016... @0016I'm counting on you.@0003
I look forward to the day I can see
this lance wielded correctly.@0003@000CUnderstood.@0003
Until that time comes, please try not to
get yourself killed, @0017General Duessel!@0003@0017@0009@0017Ha!@0003@0017
# 0x0D46

Oh, but you're not injured at
all, are you, General Duessel?@0003
We've all been struggling so hard,
and yet you don't seem tired at all.@0003
You are an impressive man.@0003
It's all I can do simply to stay
alive out here, it feels like.@0003@0017@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWhat is it?@0005
General Duessel?@0003
Is something wrong?@0003@0009Oh, um, sorry.
Your@0016...@0016@0003
From the first time I laid eyes
upon you, your face@0016...@0016@0003
I was sure I'd seen it before@0016...@0016@0003@000CHuh? Is that so?@0003
You mean before now? Or before
I even joined Grado's army?@0003@0009Yes, that's right, but I can't recall@0016...@0016
Getting to be my age has its price.@0003@000CDon't be silly!@0003
I happen to think you're still
quite young, General Duessel!@0003@0009Well, now you've got my attention! What
was it you wanted this old soldier for?@0003@000CIt's just that, even among the younger
knights, there's no match for you.@0003
And, uh@0016...@0016@0003@0009Ha ha! I'm not so old that you need to
worry about propping up my ego, lass.@0003@000CAh@0016...@0016uh@0016...@0016@0005@0003@000C@0080@001D@000CI'm sorry.@0003@0009No, no. There's no need to apologize.
@0017I quite enjoy talking to you, in fact.@0003
@0017@000C@0080@001C@0009@0017I'm sure I'm not the only one in
this army who feels that way, either.@0003
The fighting's fierce, Amelia.
You watch yourself!@0003
When you're near me, I'll make sure
I keep a good eye out for you, too.@0003
I'll be there in a flash if you need
me. Go ahead and fight without worry.@0003@0017@0017@000CAh, y-yes, sir!
Thank you very much.@0003
Fighting alongside you, General
Duessel, is a great honor.@0003

# 0x0D47
@0017@0009@0010@0119@000C@0010@0125@000CAmelia.@0003@0009General Duessel.@0003@000CIt seems like you've grown quite
comfortable with the spear.@0003@0009Yes, sir! I have, sir.
Thank you.@0003@000CYou did well to choose the spear as
your weapon. It suits your height well.@0003
It also extends your reach and
enables you to strike with force.@0003
More force, even, than a sword
could bring to bear in a battle.@0003
All weapons have their own
unique characteristics.@0003
You're familiar with the idea that some
weapons are strong against others?@0003@0009@0017Isn't that what they call@0016...@0016
the weapon triangle?@0003@0017@000C@0017Yes, it is. And from the looks of things,
your affinity for the spear is quite good.@0003
@0017If you continue to practice, you should
continue to improve and grow stronger.@0003@0009Really?@0005
Ah, that makes me happy.@0003@000CMm. To begin with, the spear
is quite a deep weapon@0016...@0016@0003
@0017Yet the attacks comprise three
surprisingly simple movements.@0003
Right step, left step, and thrust.@0003@0017@0017@0009Right step, left step, and thrust@0016...@0016
I'm following you.@0003@000CExcellent.
But listen, Amelia.@0003@0009@0080@000B@0009Y-yes?@0003@000CBecause they are so simple, they are
easy to learn but tough to perfect.@0003
They are the strongest and most
pure of techniques.@0003
When you practice them, practice
perfecting each gesture.@0003
And remember, the spear is a subtle
and powerful weapon.@0003@0009Yes, sir!@0003@000CNow it goes without saying that other
weapons have their good points, too.@0003
Swords are easy-to-use, all-purpose weapons,
and axes possess devastating strength.@0003
You should learn to use each weapon type.@0003
If you can master them all, you'll be
an unstoppable force.@0003
That is, of course, if you can overcome
your own natural affinities.@0003
To begin with, you should work on
mastering one weapon type.@0003
Then you can gradually change weapons
until you can use them all.@0003
That's what I have done, you understand.@0003
That's called being multi-proficient.@0003@0002
@0017I'd like to tell you more about different
weapons, but that lecture must wait.@0003@0017@0009@0016...@0016Wow@0016...@0016@0003
General Duessel, you know so much
about weapons, don't you?@0003
I didn't even realize how caught
up I'd become. @0017All right!@0003@0017@0009@0080@000B@000CWhat is it? Where are
you rushing off to?@0003@0009@0017I want to practice the things
you've told me about.@0003
The basics@0016--@0016right, left, thrust. Right?@0003@0017@000CMm, that's correct.
But@0016...@0016@0003
I'm happy to see you so enthused, but
do you have any reason to rush so?@0003@0009Um, well@0016...@0016@0003
There's someone@0016--@0016one of the Knights of
Renais@0016--@0016to whom I do not want to lose.@0003@000CAh.@0003@0009It's not that we're going to fight, or
that I want to defeat him or anything@0016...@0016@0003
It's just that we're kind of keeping track
of the other's progress, and@0016...@0016@0003
@0017It's just a thing we do.@0003@0017@000CI see. I think that should prove to
be a good source of motivation then.@0003
Get to it.@0003@0009@0017Yes, sir!@0003
@0017Oh@0016...@0016I think I'll, um, go and
practice over there@0016...@0016@0003
I'd be nervous in front of you, so
@0017I'm going to practice on my own.@0003
I'll be back to show you later.@0003@0017@0017@000CAll right. Understood.@0003@0009Great! See you later!@0003@0009@0011@0006@000CHa ha@0016... @0016Such energy. I feel energized
just being around her.@0003

I told you that I thought I'd seen
your face before, didn't I?@0003@0009Uh, yes.@0003@000CWell, I remembered.@0003@0009Oh, is that it?@0003
@0017Please don't keep me
waiting, tell me.@0003@0017@000C@0016......@0016@0005
Amelia. What is your mother's name?@0003@0009@0016!@0016@0005
@0016......@0016@0003
@0016...@0016My mother@0016...@0016@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0080@001E@0009My mother's name is@0016...@0016
Melina@0016...@0016@0003@000CAnd what happened to her?@0003@0009When I was just a child, she was
stolen away by bandits.@0003
My father had already passed away,
so I was totally@0016...@0016sniff@0016...@0016@0003
@0009@0080@001D@0009I'm sorry@0016...@0016
@0016......@0016@0003

@0016......@0016@0003@0009@0080@001D@000C@0016......@0016@0005
I was right@0016...@0016@0003
You can rest easy, Amelia.
Your mother is alive and well.@0003@0009@0080@001C@0009What!?@0003@000CIt happened a few years back.@0003
I was leading a patrol near
the Grado border.@0003
We unexpectedly rode up on a group of
bandits, and a battle ensued.@0003
When we had taken care of the bandits,
we rescued a lone female captive.@0003
We figured she had been taken from some
village, but she was in shock.@0003
In fact, her distress was so great, she
had forgotten much about herself.@0003
Her body was in such a weakened
state that she could barely walk.@0003
We felt such pity for her that we took
her to a peaceful village we knew of.@0003
There, we set up a home for her where
she could recover and live quietly.@0003
Some years later, she was restored
to her former vitality.@0003
Slowly, she began to recall the lost
memories of her past.@0003
Only recently did she remember that
she had once had a daughter.@0003
I took time off from my duties and visited
the village where she had lived.@0003
But the villagers told me her daughter
had left the village some time ago.@0003
With no clues as to the girl's whereabouts,
I'd almost given up hope of finding her.@0003
And then, in the strangest of places@0016...@0016@0003@0009@0080@000C@000AI-it can't be! Th-that woman@0016...@0016
What is her name?@0003@000CHer name is Melina@0016...@0016@0006
@0017Amelia, she's your mother.@0003@0017@000AWhat!?@0006
Are you@0016... @0016Are you sure?@0003@000C@0017Yes, I am. I see Melina's
face reflected in your own.@0003
There's no mistake.@0005
Isn't it wonderful, Amelia?@0003@0017@000A@0080@001E@000AMy@0016...@0016mother@0016...@0016@0003

up here as well, have you?@0003@000C@0016...@0016General Duessel.@0003
Prince Lyon no longer holds the capital.@0003
My reason for remaining is gone@0016...@0016@0003@0009Knoll, I have something
I would ask you.@0003
What exactly happened to
His Majesty and Prince Lyon?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003
Do you have the courage to
hear that answer?@0003
I think perhaps that it will not
be an answer you want to hear.@0003@0009What does that mean?@0003@000CAre you familiar with a certain foreign
anecdote of comedic nature?@0003
It involves two starving men
and a single loaf of bread.@0003
If they break the loaf in two,
both men will die of starvation@0016...@0016@0003@0009Knoll, I'm not asking for a riddle.
Let's not waste any more time here.@0003
I'm ready to hear the truth. Nothing
you tell me could surprise me.@0003@000CIf that is your wish, General
Duessel@0016... @0016I will speak frankly.@0003
This is something that Prince
Lyon does not know.@0003
Something that no one should know.@0003
# 0x0D4A
@0009@0010@0125@000C@0010@0129@000CWe students of ancient magic, along
with Prince Lyon himself,@0003
were researching certain arcane
techniques lost long ago.@0003
We were able to reproduce one@0016...@0016
phenomenon, but only briefly.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CI should be more concise.@0003
Prince Lyon and I pierced the
veil that clouds our futures.@0003@0009What? You@0016...@0016could see into
the future?@0003
How is that possible? What magic
is powerful enough to@0016--@0016@0003@000CTime is like the water of a river:
it flows ever on, never stopping.@0003
Certain disturbances can cause ripples
that speed swiftly downstream.@0003
If you can see the water, you can read
the flow, the ripples, the waves.@0003@0009Hmm@0016...@0016@0003@000CIt is possible, General. Possible
and, at times, easy. Just think of it:@0003
If you knew a storm was coming in advance,
you could evacuate everyone in its way.@0003
If you could see what was to come, you
could help those who might have died.@0003
Prince Lyon explained this to us with
much joy in his voice and heart.@0003
His power would, at long last, be able
to help the citizens of Grado.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CWe continued our work. There were
ceremonies, rituals@0016--@0016such horrors@0016...@0016@0003
And then we saw it.@0003
In the near future, Grado would be
ravaged by catastrophe.@0003@0009A catastrophe? Do you@0016...@0016@0003@000CNo, it's not the conflict in which
we are currently embroiled.@0003
This event is still in our future.@0003
We saw Grado. We saw the earth
crumble. We saw our people dying.@0003
We saw the shape our future would take.@0003@0009What?
That's madness@0016... @0016Idiocy!@0003
I've lived a long life, and I've
never heard of anything like that.@0003
Not ever.@0003@000CI am not surprised that you do not
believe me, General.@0003
We could not believe it, either. We
tried to disprove what we had seen.@0003
But nothing could shake the vision.@0003
In this disaster, Grado would be
destroyed. Countless would die.@0003
Those who died quickly would be
spared the slow horror of starvation.@0003
This was when the emperor died, by the
way. Lyon was shattered by despair.@0003
He devoted himself to research, and
then came the Dark Stone@0016...@0016@0003@0009So that's what happened?@0003
Is that when the decision
to invade Renais was made?@0003@000CI don't know.@0003
Only one person knows
the truth behind that.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CI have told you only the
truths I have seen.@0003

Worn to the bone.@0003
I understand how you feel, but on the
battlefield, this only invites death.@0003@000CYou are probably right@0016...@0016@0003
And yet that might be best.@0003@0009What are you planning to
do from here on?@0003@000CI do not know@0016...@0016@0003
I have lost my way.@0003
Perhaps I should have been
executed in the capital.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CI once studied dark magic
alongside Prince Lyon.@0003
He was such a gentle soul. You could
see it@0016--@0016he was too kind to survive.@0003
Prince Lyon dreamt of finding happiness
for all of Grado's citizens.@0003@0009@0016......@0016@0003@000CAnd now, Prince Lyon is no more.@0003
I have lost everything.@0003@0009I have also lost everything.@0003
And we have both lost our ways.@0003
We are dead men who have stayed
too long away from our graves.@0003
But remember, Knoll@0016...@0016@0003
You cannot see the future, but you
can look back at your past.@0003
Look and learn. And remember.@0003
What gave your life meaning, and what
has taken meaning from you now?@0003@000C@0016......@0016@0003@0009If you still hold the convictions that
guided you in Grado, you can start anew.@0003
That@0016... @0016That is what I must do.@0003
We may be diminished by our shame, but
we are not dead yet, my friend.@0003@000CGeneral Duessel@0016...@0016@0003
I am not as strong as you.@0003
Still, @0017I believe you are right.
I, too, shall search for a new path.@0003@0002
@0017A path that guides me to realizing the
dreams Prince Lyon once held so dear.@0003

@0008That's because your cooking is atrocious.@0003
@0009Arckady, what news do you bring from 
the south?@0003
@000BRight. Gradin's men are multiplying. 
They're levying heavy taxes and@0003
offering nothing in return,
they're jailing people who resist or simply@0003
cannot pay. Not sure how much longer my 
family will be able to hold out.@0003 
@0009I see... even in a rural state like Belaro, 
the farthest reaches are unsafe from@0003

It appears the situation grows more 
dire for all of us with each passing day.@0003

@000BIt's crazy!

@000C@0010@0108@000CA battle? Here?
Those merchants look like they could use@0003
some more help. I was told to deliver
my message and then head back home,@0003
but I don't want to come back without
a story to tell. Besides, a soldier@0003
from Mahala never backs down!@0003

@0008@0010@0102@000A@0010@0104@000B@0010@0105@000D@0010@0106@000DWe're all here, Storch. 
What's the word on tonight?@0003
Pickpocketing more 
wealthy folk? @0003
@0008Not tonight. Esfir has news.@0003
@000AThere's a merchant caravan 
passing through here tonight.@0003
It's a small caravan,@0003
but they have no guard.@0003
They'll be an 
easy target. We strip them@0003 
for what they're@0003 
worth and send
them back on their way.@0003
@000BNo guard? It is clear they 
are not from around here.@0003
@000DWho cares, it makes 
our lives even easier!@0003
@0008Yeah, but we gotta be careful. 
We're not the only ones@0003
doing this kind of thing.@0003 
A lot of people are getting into this line of 
work with the taxes and all.@0003
@000AStorch is right. I don't think the 
merchants will be the issue.@0003
@000BIt's the other bandits. Tell me, Esfir, 
how did you come upon this information?@0003
@000AThis group of merchants is
new to the area,@0003
they come from the capitol. 
They're peddling@0003
what no one will buy in between the 
mountains, and are trying@0003
to offload it here.@0003
They know they aren't 
going to cut a profit,@0003
so they're looking to unload and break even.@0003 
I overheard them at the tavern.@0003
It seems the people of Belaro cannot 
even afford  discount goods. They're@0003
heading back earlier than expected.
They're in a hurry, hence why they@0003
didn't think to get a guard.@0003@000BAmateurs.@0003
@000DBut wait, if they couldn't sell anything,@0003
how do we know they have money?@0003
@000AThey're from the capitol. 
Merchants from the capitol nearly on par@0003
with the aristocrats here. They have 
deep pockets lined with gold.@0003
@0008Rich and arrogant... 
makes it a bit easier to swallow, then.@0003
@000AQuite. Storch, we should head out soon.@0003
@0008... Yeah. Let's go.@0003
# 0x0D5E
@000B@0010@0106@000BThey're sitting ducks! At first I felt bad
for stealing, but now they're making@0003
me feel bad if I don't! They may as well @0003
leave the gold out on their front porch 
for us.@0003
@000A@0010@0105I don't think it'll be so easy, cousin.@0003 
Look. We have company.@0003
@000BWhat? I can't see through
this fog!@0003
@000D@0010@0102@000DBandits... Esfir was right.@0003
@0008@0010@0107Wait, are they gonna rob them too?
But we were here first, that's not fair.@0003
@000DI don't think this works like that, Lera.@0003
@0008We should beat them up!@0003
@000DI really don't want to get 
into another fight...@0003
@0008@0011
@0008@0010@0104Actually, Storch. Lera makes a good point.
If we were to swoop in and fight the bandits,@0003
we may get a reward.@0003@000CEsfir, you sly cougar, 
that's daft enough to work.@0003
@000DIt seems dishonest, but to be fair,
we were going to steal from them.@0003
@0009And if they don't give us a reward, 
we can rob them blind anyway.@0003 
It's the best course of action.@0003
@000DAlright, let's get 
ready for a tussle. Remember that our@0003 
goal is to defend the merchants! 
Don't let anyone get near 'em!@0003 
# 0x0D5F
@0008@0010@0158@000A@0010@0158@0009
@000D@0010@0104@000B@0010@0102Are you alright?@0003
@0008Yes, thanks to you.
Your timing was impeccable.@0003
@000AOh yes, we are most gracious@0003
you could protect 
our rich-@0003 
I mean, protect us.@0003
@0008Indeed. But it begs the question. 
Why are you militiamen@0003
out at night this# 0x far from town?@0003
Surely you have better things
to do than patrol this area.@0003
@000BMilitiamen?@0003
@000DWe only heard of the bandits
in the area after you had left town.@0003
We came to make@0003 
sure you were alright.@0003
I'm glad that none of 
you are harmed.@0003
@000AI see.@0003 
I suppose your noble deed deserves 
a reward.@0003
I didn't expect such 
generosity in Belaro.@0003
@0008Most generous indeed! 
Please, take this as thanks.@0003
@000BThis is...@0003 
@000DWonderful. Thank you for the kind gift.@0003
@0008It is a small price to pay for saving us 
from those ruinous brigands!@0003 
Tell me, what are your names?@0003
@000B ... Storch. And this is Esfir.@0003
@000AWe'll remember that.@0003
Your exploits tonight 
will not be forgotten.@0003 
@0008Take care.@0003
@0008@0011@0009@0011
@000D@0080@000B@000B@0011@0009@0080@000A@0009@0010@0104@0009This is quite a sum. 
Could you imagine what it'd look like@0003 
if we were able to go with the plan?@0003
@000CYou know, I thought being the 
good guy for a change would feel nice.@0003 
But it doesn't.@0003
@0009You let many things weigh 
on your mind, Storch. If you focus@0003
only on survival, you won't sweat
the small stuff.@0003
@000CSurvival... 
Yeah, I get what you mean.@0003
Thanks Esfir, I'll try to remember that.@0003
@0009You're new to this. It's only natural to stress.
Your swordsmanship has improved.@0003
By the end of all this,
you could leave the farm@0003
and travel as a mercenary.
You can make much more money@0003
doing that, Storch.@0003
@000CNo thanks.
I'd be content just going back to being@0003
a farm boy. Even when we do the 
right thing, it doesn't sit well with me.@0003
Not one bit. The money's nice and all,
if only to prevent my parents from@0003
struggling, but I don't 
want to do this much longer.@0003
@0009None of us do, Storch. 
This isn't going to end until Gradin eases@0003
 his taxes. It's either we resort to this or 
we starve. Vagelis already laid out @0003
those options for you.@0003
@000CPah, don't remind me. 
Anyway...@0003
we should head back to town for the night.@0003 
We should stay at the inn. I don't think any 
of our places are near enough.@0003
@0008@0010@0106The inn at this town has a great bar. 
I'm buying you an ale, Storch! We deserve it,@0003
we're heroes now after all. Who'd of thought,@0003 
a ragtag bunch like us being heroes? 
Paid to protect and serve!@0003
Knights of the square table!@0003 
They'll make stories about us!@0003
@000CHeroes...@0003
@000D@0010@0105Make that two.@0003
@0008That's my cousin! 
Let's head back quick before they close up.@0003
@000DBehind you.@0003@0008@0011@000D@0011
@0009They don't seem worried. 
Ease up, Storch.@0003
@000CTake it with a grain of salt. 
Arckady's no smarter than a stone,@0003 
and Vagelis wouldn't flinch if he was on fire. 
They're not exactly the best people@0003
for me to compare to.@0003
@0009Nevertheless, there is much you
can learn from them both.@0003
@000CYes, mom.@0003
@0009Tch, let's go... I could use an ale too.@0003

# 0x0D60
@000C@0010@0105@0009@0010@0102When was the last time you went home?@0003
@000CBeen a while now. Probably as long as you.@0003
@0009Yeah... It's been over a month since
I handed my parents my share@0003
of the money
from the merchants.@0003
@000CThat was quite a haul.
Our families should be able to pay@0003 
taxes for a few months, at least.@0003
@0009I hope you're right... 
I just want to be able to rest easy,@0003
go back to how things were.@0003
@000CStorch. You haven't been yourself lately.
Is something wrong?@0003
@0009I guess I'm a little homesick, 
is all. I worry about Marlen.@0003
@000CYou shouldn't worry so much about your
younger brother. He's more capable@0003 
than you think. He's certainly better 
on horseback than you are.@0003
@0009Hey! You know that I feel funny
riding on an animal.@0003
It never felt right to me.@0003
I like keeping my feet firmly planted on the 
ground, no need to stray far.@0003
You and I both know everything he knows
about sword fighting he learned from me!@0003
@000CHa, I'm teasing you. Ease up.
I'm sure Marlen is fine.@0003
# 0x0D61
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@010AStorch?@0003
So it takes an attack on our 
town for you to show your face?@0003
@000CHi, Larisa.@0003 
@0009Is that all you have to say?
We haven't spoken in months!@0003
Every time I come looking for you,
your brother says you aren't around.@0003
@000CMarlen isn't lying... 
Look, just be careful, okay?@0003
This is a battlefield.@0003@000C@0011@0009Don't worry about me! I'll be... fine. 
Sigh... Will he ever grow up?@0003

@000CYes, we're all accounted for.@0003
# 0xOpenMidLfett ... Whew. That was intense.@0003
@000CBut it's not over yet, look there.@0003
@0009What? Imperial soldiers?
@0009@0011@000C@0011
@000C@0010@014C@000CSo these must be the brigands... 
They've done quite a number here.@0003
@0009@0010@0159@0009You're mistaken! They saved us!
@000CLies! I recognize them, they were stealing@0003
from a nearby village months ago. 
They are a threat to your safety!@0003
Men! Pursue the bandits!@0003
@0009Fools...@0003 
@000CHmph? What was that?@0003
@0009Y-you heard me! 
Gradin and his men are thugs,@0003
terrorizing the people with his cruel taxes.
His taxes are white collar banditry!@0003
@000CYou will cease this talk 
or you will be tried for treason@0003
against the state.@0003
@0009...@0003
@000CTch, thought so.
Moan and whine all you want, but@0003
remember who runs the show here.
Men! Pursue the bandits!@0003
Don't let them escape!@0003
# 0x0D67
@000A@0010@0109@000B@0010@0107@000BPort Irene! I feel like it's@0003
been a heck of a long time
since we were here.@0003
@000AWe used to come here when we were 
little to browse all the shops@0003
and eat some of the imported 
fruit from Mahala.@0003 
Brings back a lot of memories of@0003
my brothers and I.@0003
@000BYeah...@0003
When my mom and I came out
here from the capitol,@0003
we spent a few months@0003
here while she worked 
and I studied.@0003
I love the smell of 
the ocean breeze.@0003
@000D@0010@0104Makes you feel at ease, doesn't it?@0003
@000BMm, I always liked it here.@0003
@000AMe too.@0003
@0008@0010@010EHello, are you just arriving?@0003
@000DYes, we're just arriving to port.
Can we help you?@0003
@0008This town is unsafe. A group
of pirates just disembarked.@0003
I'd suggest you leave before
you don't have a choice.@0003
@000AP-pirates? Why are they here?@0003
@000DThis isn't good. They'll tear this
place apart..@0003
@000BMom! We have to do
something! We can't let them@0003
destroy the Port!@0003
@000DYou're right. Sir, please allow
us to deal with the pirates.@0003
@0008Oh? Are you mercenaries?@0003
@000DSomething like that. Let me
go inform our leader that we're in for@0003
another fight.@0003
@0008Thank you. O goddess, bless
these kind travelers... I am Onisim,@0003
a simple priest. I do not fight, but
please allow me to@0003
heal your wounded.@0003
@000AYou sure, mister? I don't want
you to get hurt!@0003
@0008As long as I follow
in the light, I cannot be harmed.@0003
I do not fear death, only the 
judgment that comes therein.@0003
@000AOh... okay then. 
Let's get ready!@0003
# 0x0D68
@0009@0010@0102@0009Alright everyone, looks like
we're going up against pirates.@0003
Looks like instead of hearing
the news, we're gonna be it.@0003
But that's the breaks!@0003
I don't want to have to do
this either, but let's get started.@0003
Protect the homes and drive out
the pirates!@0003
# 0x0D69
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010C@000COnisim? Is that you?
Good god, man!@0003
You're bulging out of them
there priest robes!@0003
@0009Nazar... 
It is nice to see you again,@0003
however I did not ever dream
that it would be like this.@0003
You look troubled, why are you
standing by?@0003
There is an unprotected.
home that looks like a prime target@0003
for looting and pillaging.
It's unlike you. Are you well?@0003
@000COni my old friend, 
as soon as Borst started going@0003
after women and children,
I just couldn't do it anymore.@0003
I want to be a good guy! Maybe not
become a priest and all that@0003
hub-bub, but you know, a stand-up guy.@0003
Besides, the crew ain't been the same
since you left. I love the sea, but@0003
the life of a pirate, nay, it's not for me.@0003
@0009Then fight with us, old friend.@0003
@000CYou always were one of those
holier than thou types, eh Oni?@0003
@0009Walking with the light... 
It works for me. @0003
I still have much to repent for...@0003
@000CPlenty of time to repent! 
Alright, I'm coming with ya!@0003
@0009Nazar... Thank you.@0003
# 0x0D6A

Where are we gonna sleep now?@0003
@0009Hic... 
He shouldn't have tried to hit on@0003
you like that, Dewi.@0003
@000CI can handle myself, Sri!@0003
@0009Ha, you would've never gotten
out of Kuching if you were on your own.@0003
You need your good ol' brother to 
help you out, right sister?@0003
Hic...@0003
@000CSri! Pay attention.
It looks like we've been thrown out@0003
to a battlefield.@0003
@0009At this time of night?
I don't have time for this,@0003
I need to get to bed.@0003
@000CWe have no money left,
you do realize that, right?@0003
Had you not tried to attack the barkeep,
we wouldn't be in this mess!@0003
@0009Right... spent our last bit of
gold on that ale. Ah well, money comes@0003
and goes, right? Looks like we both may 
have found our next score.@0003
# 0x0D6B
@0008@0010@010F@000A@0010@0110@000C@0010@0102Hey, what are you two doing out here? 
They're after us, you should go hide.@0003
No need for you to risk getting hurt.@0003
@0008We can handle ourselves
 just fine, thanks.@0003
@000AThis ain't no big deal.@0003
We've survived worse.@0003
@0008Why are you fighting at this time
of night though?@0003
Why are these soldiers after you?@0003
@000CWe're hunted by the state
and they see us as a threat.@0003
@000ASounds familiar.@0003
@0008Quiet! Tell me, what is your name?@0003
@000CI'm Storch. And you are...?@0003
@0008I'm Dewi, and this is my twin 
brother, Sri. We're... @0003
travelers from Kuching. 
Actually, I think I have an idea...@0003
Let us fight with you.
@000AHuh? Really, sister?@0003
@0008He can use protecting,
and we can use money.@0003
@000AThat's easy for you to say!
You just heal people with your staff.@0003
I end up doing all the actual fighting!@0003
@000CKuching? You came so far to 
come to this dinky place?@0003
Whatever the case,@0003
Not sure I can pay you 
very much, but you're welcome@0003
to stick around.@0003
@0008We can discuss terms later. 
Well met, Storch.@0003
I think this will be a fruitful partnership!@0003
@0009Aw heck, this is why you 
should let me do the talking, sis...@0003
# 0x0D6C
@000B@0010@0108@0009@0010@0102Hey.
Sorry you got mixed up in all this.@0003
@000BGlad I could lend a hand.
Are you members of a local militia@0003
as the merchant said?@0003
I'm not from around here,
but I've never seen@0003
a militia group that
looked like this.@0003
@0009 ... Not exactly. It's a bit complex.
I mean-@0003
@000D@0010@0104@000DStorch.@0003
She helped us, you don't
need to lie to her.@0003
Natsuko, was it?@0003 
We're citizens from a 
nearby town.@0003 
Due to the increase in@0003
taxes, our group is engaging in robbery@0003
in order to prevent our
families from starving,@0003
going to jail, or both.@0003 
This time, it appeared
that helping the merchants was@0003
better than looting them.@0003@0009Esfir! Isn't- Shouldn't we be more
secretive about this kind of stuff?@0003
I mean, of all the-
@000BNo, I understand, Storch. 
There's no need to hide.@0003
I appreciate your honesty. 
I'm a messenger from@0003
Mahala. I was traveling to deliver
a message to a noble in the capitol,@0003 
and was heading back through
Belaro. Carelessly, I traveled by@0003
night and found myself on a battlefield.@0003@000DWe're lucky you arrived.@0003
Have you been a messenger for some time?@0003
@000BNo, I'm fairly new to this still.@0003
This was my first message
to deliver in Nevan.@0003
In Mahala, junior soldiers first become@0003
messengers before entering 
into a combat unit.@0003
In my class, I was one of the
last to get such an important task as this.@0003
But I still feel like I have much to prove
to them, and myself.@0003
@000DWhy don't you consider traveling
with us for a while then, Natsuko?@0003
@0009Are you serious?@0003
@000BLike I said,
I'm low on the@0003
totem pole back home.@0003
It gets tough to keep
pushing forward when@0003
you feel like you're 
spinning your wheels.@0003
Maybe a change of pace
would be just what I need.@0003
I suppose I could send in
a request for leave...@0003
In fact., I may just do that.@0003
Besides, the mountain views
in Nevan from atop a pegasus@0003
are stunning. Much better than
the sea of sand you get back home.@0003@000DNatsuko, I think we're going to
get along just fine.@0003 
Come now, the others are
far ahead of us.@0003
@000BStorch, Esfir... Thank you.
I know I have a lot to prove,@0003
but you can count on me!@0003
# 0x0D6D
@0009@0010@0109@000D@0010@0160@000B@0010@015A
Marlen, you and your mother 
should hide in the basement.@0003
You'll be safe there.@0003
@0009Dad, what about you?@0003
@000BI'll stay up here and keep an eye out. 
Don't worry about me, Marlen.@0003
@0009But dad! 
Your leg still hasn't healed,@0003
let me guard the house.@0003
@000BNo! Marlen, it's too dangerous.@0003
@0009You taught me how to ride horses,
and Storch taught me how to use a sword.@0003
I can protect us if anyone comes near, but 
you're not in any shape to! Please, dad!@0003
Lera ran to find Storch. They're gonna come
save us, I just know it. I can hold out in@0003
the meantime, but you gotta trust me. Dad!@0003
@000DHe makes a good point, dear. 
You shouldn't overexert yourself.@0003
@000BHard to argue with a woman... 
Alright, you win, Marlen. We'll be down in@0003
the basement. Be careful, you hear!@0003
@0009Right. I'll do my best!@0003
@000B@0011@000D@0011@0009Storch, Lera... I hope you both
come back soon.@0003

@000C@0010@010A@000CFinally got all of this armor on, 
gotta go help out the village. If they take@0003
the shop dad will be ruined!

not having money and all.@0003
# 0x0D6F
@000C@0010@0104@0009@0010@0102This... Looks awful.
Is this our punishment?@0003
@000CFocus, Storch! 
Marlen and your parents are in there still.@0003
It looks like some of the villagers have
taken up arms, I'm sure Marlen is@0003
fighting with them.@0003
@0009 ... You're right. We have to persevere.@0003
I'm not gonna let anyone
harm my family!@0003 
@0009@0011@000CStorch!
Don't rush into battle!@0003
Tch, there's no reasoning with him
when it comes to this...@0003
# 0x0D70
@000D@0010@0105@000A@0010@0102@0008@0010@0106@0008Storch, you absolute madman, 
you tore this place to shreds!@0003
You're like a crazed beast on the battlefield!
There was so much blood, they could call you@0003
"The Scarlet Swordsman", my god man!
I ain't ever seen this side of you before.@0003
@000DIt was... something.@0003
@000A... Where is Marlen?@0003
@0008Relax, the kid's alright! 
Saw him, he handled himself@0003
pretty well out there.@0003
@000B@0010@0109@000BBrother!@0003
@000AMarlen... 
Where are our parents?@0003
@000BThey're safe, brother. 
I told you! They're hiding in the basement.@0003
@000AI see... Thank you, Marlen. 
I'm glad you're safe.@0003
@000BAw heck, brother. 
I just did what you would do is all.@0003
@000AMarlen... Let's go see mom and dad.@0003
@000A@0011@000B@0011
@0008Hey Vagelis! 
You know ol' Storch better than me,@0003
is he always so... like this? 
It's like he's here but he's only@0003
focusing on one thing, and tuning out
all of the other things, you know?@0003
@000DI hear you, cousin. 
He's been like this since his older brother-@0003
@0008Older brother? 
Vagelis, you slippery toad,@0003
nobody every told me Storch had
an older brother!@0003
@000D... I think Storch tries to forget too.@0003
His elder bro-@0003
@000A@0010@010AArckady, it is nice to see you again. 
Vagelis.@0003
@000D... Larisa.@0003
@0008Larisa! 
You're looking all fine in that armor of@0003
yours. Tell me, who taught you to wield@0003
a lance like that?
You're one heck of a force!@0003
@000AStow it, boy. Where's Storch?@0003
@000DHis house.
He's not interested.@0003
@0008Way to cut right to the chase, cousin.
Yow!@0003
@000AN-no, it's not that, Vagelis.
I mean, a woman of my stature and wealth@0003
would not be so foolish as to associate
with such an uncouth vagabond!@0003
@000DKeep telling yourself that.@0003
@000AY-you!!@0003
@0008Woah now! 
I'm about to m-o-v-e out of this@0003
conversation.@0003
I thought battles got heated, but hoo boy,
Vagelis, you sure know how to dial it up.@0003
Maybe you should
take a breather too. Let's go, cousin.@0003
@000DRight.@0003
@000D@0011
@0008Lovely seeing you again, Larisa!
Get home safe now, you hear?@0003
@0008@0011
@000AHe's as antagonistic as ever. 
I suppose I can't blame him,@0003
he always was a loyal@0003
friend to Storch. Alas, Larisa, why do you
find yourself caught in this struggle?@0003

@0009Yes, we're all accounted for.@0003
@000C ... Whew. That was intense.
I thought the bandit thing was tough,@0003
but fighting them is a whole new level.@0003
@0009But it's not over yet, look there.@0003
@000CWhat? Imperial soldiers?@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0011
@0009@0010@014CSo these must be the brigands... 
They've done quite a number here.@0003
@000C@0010@0159You're mistaken! They saved us!
@0009Lies! I recognize them, 
they were stealing from a nearby@0003
village months ago. 
They are a threat to your safety!@0003 
Men! Pursue the bandits!@0003
@000CPah, fools...@0003 
@0009Hmph? What was that?
@000CY-you heard me!
Gradin and his men are thugs.@0003
terrorizing the people with his cruel taxes. 
His taxes are white collar banditry!@0003
@0009You will cease this talk,
or you will be tried for treason.@0003
@000C...@0003
@0009Tch, thought so.
You commoners like to talk@0003
a big game, but when push
comes to shove, you run@0003
and hide and let the soldiers
do the fighting.@0003
Get one whiff of a fight
and you'd turn tail and run.@0003
Pah. After them!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0011
@000C@0010@0102They're heading this way. 
We need to escape, now!@0003
# 0x0D76
@000C@0010@0102Damn...
More soldiers. Looks like they're gonna@0003
try and surround us. Push through! 
Let's all get out of here alive!@0003@0009@0010@0105@0009Storch. We are here with you.
If need be, we can cover your escape.@0003
We'll all find a way out of here alive.@0003@000CVagelis, when I escape, so 
does everyone else.@0003
I'm not leaving anyone behind!
Not you, not Marlen, not anyone!@0003@0009Storch... You are a good friend.
When you escape, we will all@0003
follow close behind. Let's go.@0003@000CRight!

@000B@0010@0104@000D@0010@0102@000DAre we all here?
Jeez, this is exhausting.@0003@000BIt appears so, 
we shouldn't stick around much longer.@0003
@000DAt least let's catch our breaths here. 
Is everyone accounted for?@0003 
And you two, sorry for dragging you
both into this mess.@0003
We didn't even have time
to really introduce ourselves.@0003
I'm Storch, and this is Esfir.@0003
@000AAye lad,
I found myself in situations far stickier@0003
than what we had 'ere. Worry not.@0003
@0008It is fine, Storch.
Tell me, why does the state hunt you?@0003
@000DWe're fugitives.
That woman, the halberdier,@0003
she caught us stealing months ago,
and has pursued us doggedly since.@0003
@0008So are you a band of thieves?
I've seen my fair share of gangs,@0003
but your group doesn't strike me as such.@0003
@000DWe were driven to it to provide for our families.
The taxes imposed by Gradin have left many@0003
of our families struggling to survive.
All of us are here to do what we can@0003
to provide for them. 
None of us, me especially,@0003
are proud of what we have to do.@0003
@0008Yet, you protected us 
from our former- I mean, the pirates.@0003
@000A...@0003
@000DI won't deny we're thieves,
but we aren't morally bankrupt either.@0003
@0008That much is clear.
I apologize for questioning you.@0003
I am Onisim, a humble priest
seeking atonement.@0003
I fear that returning to my church
will only cause stress, may I travel with you?@0003
@000DOf course, we don't do much of 
anything fun, so be prepared to rough it.@0003
@0008In my previous life, I was a pirate, 
a murderer with no shame... @0003
I can't imagine traveling with you could be
any worse than that.@0003
@000A...@0003
@000DYou've been quiet.
You were fighting with the pirates.@0003
You two know each other?@0003
@000AAye, we were companions many a'year ago,
reunited today by fate, so it were.@0003
I am Nazar, an axeman of the sea.@0003
@000DI see. I'm Storch, and this is Esfir.
As long as you behave yourself and@0003
can put your axe arm to use,
I see no reason for you to not travel with us.@0003
@000AAye. You'll see only the 
best from me, lad.@0003
@000DMhm, welcome aboard.@0003
@000BGood, we should keep moving.@0003
@000DWhere are we headed?
We need to lay low, and chances are@0003
they'll make their way to our houses... 
Probably safer if we don't go back home.@0003
@000BNot sure... 
We may need to camp in the forest.@0003
@000DUgh, again?
Pah, I suppose that we don't@0003
have much of a choice.@0003
@000AAye, if I may, Cap'n Storch.@0003
@000DNazar?
Do you know somewhere?@0003
@000AYes, near the southern border is a port
I frequent many times in my day.@0003
An old friend runs an inn and the scallywag
owes me a favor and an ale.@0003
He ain't too far from 'ere.@0003
@0008He's a fine man,
I'm sure he will take us in.@0003
@000BSounds like our best option then.@0003
@000DAgreed, show us the way.@0003
@000AAye, follow me.@0003
# 0x0D79
@0009@0010@014C@0009They're still fighting? Pah!@0003
Looks like I'll have to take care
of this myself.@0003
Hunt them down, don't let them escape!@0003
# 0x0D7A
@0009@0010@FFFFHm? There's no one here...@0003
# 0x0D7B
@0009@0010@FFFF@000C@0010@015C@000CMy buddy wanted to meet me for drinks,
told me to bring my hammer, so I went out@0003
and bought this. But then when I saw him,
he told me I misunderstood.@0003
He wanted to get hammered!
So now I have this axe that I don't know@0003
how to use. Maybe it's good for something?@0003
I don't know, I'm just a villager. You can
probably figure this out, right?@0003
# 0x0D7C
@000C@0010@FFFF@0009@0010@015E@0009Hey! You're fighting pirates?
Wow! That's so neat!@0003
I thought pirates were cool, 
cuz they're always saying stuff@0003
like "Argh, matey!" or "yo ho ho!"
and they have sweet beards!@0003
Heck, I hope I can get cool facial
hair too someday.@0003
Man, I wish I could be out there with
you! But my mom would be@0003
really upset if I left here, so 
just take this! I think it works@0003
kinda like a candle.
Good luck!@0003
# 0x0D7D
@000C@0010@FFFF@0009@0010@015F@0009Why hello there, young one.
I bet you'd like to find a way to@0003
better deal with all this cavalry.
Why don't you take this?@0003
My son was a soldier for Lord Gradin,
and he used this to fight in Kuching@0003
years ago. Maybe this will be of use to you.@0003
# 0x0D7E
@000C@0010@0132So, he's come back?

And look, Storch came home!@0003
@000AMom, dad, are you both alright?@0003
@000DMy sons... 
Oh, I'm so glad you're both safe.@0003
@000B ... Storch. 
We're fine, how's the damage outside?@0003
@000AIt's kept to a minimum, 
I don't think they'll be coming@0003
back anytime soon.@0003
@0008Storch swooped in right in the nick of time,
dad, like a real hero!@0003
@000A...@0003
@000B... Right. 
Marlen, take your mother upstairs.@0003
We should be off to sleep soon.@0003
@0008Yes, dad.@0003
@000DStorch, thank you... 
Have a good rest.@0003
Please feel free to stay the night.@0003
@000AGoodnight, mom.@0003
@000D@0011@0008@0011
@000BI don't know where the
hell you've been off to,@0003
or where this money is coming from,
but it seems like too strange@0003
of a coincidence that bandits would
come to our neck of the woods@0003
the same time you decide to show up.@0003
@000A...@0003
@000BNothing to say?
It's as they say, what goes around@0003
comes around. You better shape up, boy.
Your mother damn near had a heart attack@0003
waiting for Marlen to come home. 
It's hard enough for us to scrape@0003
by on the money we have with these
oppressive taxes, and if you're@0003
responsible for bringing 
bandits to our front door@0003
to take the leftovers...@0003
@000AIt's not like that, dad.
I've been working up at the port...@0003
as a mercenary. 
Guarding merchants... @0003
that sort of thing.@0003
@000BDon't bullshit me, boy.
Ain't nobody would be a big enough@0003
fool to hire a sniveling coward like you.
You and your friends best get@0003
of here before
the sun rises and more trouble@0003
comes through. You better stop coming
around to drop off coin, too.@0003
I'm not going to take it anymore now that
I've confirmed where it's coming from.@0003
Last thing we need is more death
in this family.@0003@000ADad!@0003
@000BI've said what I wanted to say.
Don't come back here, Storch.@0003
It's for your own good.@0003
You're going down a path
I cannot condone.@0003
There's no joy in surviving
if it's through unjust means.@0003
Maybe one day you'll see that.@0003
@000AAlright.
I see how it is, dad.@0003
I only wish you could see from
my perspective... I only want to help.@0003
If that makes me too much of a burden,
then so be it. Farewell, father.@0003
Tell mom I'm sorry.@0003
# 0x0D81

around for a few days, Storch?@0003
@0009No, we leave tonight@0003
@000C... Alright.
I'll inform the others.@0003
We should head back up north to the port,
sure we'll hear some rumors there.@0003
@000C@0011
@000B@0010@0109
Brother!@0003
@0009Marlen?
What are you doing out here?@0003
@000BI should ask you the same question!
Why aren't you back home?@0003
@0009 ... I'm not welcome there anymore.@0003
@000BB-but why?@0003
@0009Dad says so,
and it's his house and all,@0003
so I gotta be off.@0003
@000BAnd everyone else is going with you too?
Vagelis, Lera, Esfir... all of them?@0003
@0009That's right.@0003
@000BLet me join you, brother!@0003
@0009No, brother.
We're knee deep in some dangerous stuff.@0003
Marlen, you wouldn't want to get involved.
If anything were to happen to you...@0003
@000BYou saw how I fought back there!
I'm better on horseback than you.@0003
I'm ready for this, honest!@0003
@0009No, Marlen. It's too dangerous.
You need to stay here with mom and dad.@0003
Dad's not in the same shape as he was,
and mom can use the help too.@0003
@000BSniff... @0003
@0009Don't cry, Marlen.
You're too old to cry.@0003
@000BI just...
I just don't want to lose you...@0003
Sniff...@0003
@0009 ...@0003
@000BDad's changed, Storch.
It's real depressing and all to be home.@0003
He's always muttering about you
and Augustyn...@0003
You gotta let me come with you!@0003
@0009Augustyn... 
Alright. I suppose it's easier to protect you@0003
if you're close by. 
This isn't the easy street, Marlen.@0003
I hope you're ready for what's to come.@0003
@000BY-you mean it?
Brother?@0003
@0009I may regret this, but you need
to be strong, alright?@0003
Strong for me, mom... even dad.
I spend so much of my time@0003
worrying about you, I guess it'll
be easier for me if I know you're@0003
right next to me, right?
I'll do my best to protect you,@0003
but don't be reliant on me!
You gotta be able to fend for@0003
yourself. You hear me?@0003
@000BI won't let you down, brother!@0003
@000D@0010@010A... I'm coming too.@0003
@0009Larisa?@0003
@000DLook, Storch.
I know that you and I aren't@0003
on the best terms,@0003
but I want to help. 
I care as much about this@0003
town as you do.
The shop isn't doing as well as it once did.@0003
If you're heading north to find work,@0003
count me in. 
Even though we're fine financially,@0003
and run the best smithy in town...
extra gold couldn't hurt.@0003@0009... Alright. 
Thank you, Larisa.@0003
It's dangerous business we're in.
Be ready for the worst.@0003
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Fighting every day, heck,@0003
exhausting ain't even able to
articulate how it feels!@0003
But if it's what we gotta do
to survive these taxes,@0003
then it's worth fighting for.@0003
@000BWith all of us together,
we'll be fine!@0003
@0009Let's hope that's the case this time.@0003

woman to woman.@0003
@0009Marlen IS NOT my boyfriend!@0003
@000COh? My apologies.@0003
Maybe if my daughter told me
where she was going,@0003
I wouldn't have to draw
my own conclusions.@0003
@0009Alright, alright.
I'm sorry for lying.@0003
I did pick up food.@0003
Marlen helped me with the vegetables
since he knows how to@0003
pick out the good ones,
being a farmer and all.@0003
@000CIt's okay.@0003
Please don't feel like you
need to hide from me, Lera.@0003
If you aren't truthful with me,
I can't protect you.@0003
And if anything were to happen to you...@0003
@0009 know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.@0003
@000CThank you, love.@0003
When the battle is over,@0003
we'll be sure to talk more
about your boyfriend.@0003
I'd love to hear about him.@0003
@000C@0011
@0009He's not!!
Ugh, moms are so annoying.@0003

Storch?@0003
Your shift isn't for another hour.
You should get your rest.@0003
@000BHey, Vagelis.@0003
Sorry, having trouble sleeping tonight.
How are you holding up?@0003
@000ANot better, not worse. 
I am neutral.@0003
I'm doing what needs to be done.@0003
@000BWish I could be as stoic
as you are, Vagelis.@0003
This whole thing, it's crazy.@0003
Just a couple of months ago,
we were hanging out on the farm,@0003
drinking ale and having a good old time.@0003
Now we're fugitives to some, and heroes
to others!@0003
@000AYes.@0003
This change has come
rather quickly.@0003
I did not expect us to become
such high profile prey for@0003
Lord Gradin himself.@0003
@000BYeah... I'm just trying not
to let it get to me.@0003
It's like you said, we're doing
what needs to be done.@0003
Nothing more, nothing less.@0003@000AHey...
Did you hear that?@0003
@000BYeah... 
Behind that barrel.@0003
@000A@0080@000F@000D@0011@000D@0010@0105Come out with your 
hands raised, or you're dead.@0003
@000A@0010@016B
@000CDon't move.@0003
Talk. 
Who are you?@0003
@000A...@0003 
@000DCant' find the words, can you?
Don't play this game with me.@0003
I am not one for games.@0003
@0008@0010@016B
@0008You're all under arrest.
Do not resist.@0003
If you resist, you will- grah!@0003
@0008@0011
@000AY-you...
Blast!@0003
@000A@0011
@000DDamn!@0003
The other one got away.@0003
@000BNot this again...@0003
Everyone! We've got company!@0003


# 0x0D89
@000C@0010@0135@0009@0010@016BWe've found them!
They're holed up in an inn to the east!@0003
@000CExcellent, Lesley will be most pleased
when we bring back their heads.@0003
Let none of them escape, 
we'll all share the reward, men!@0003

It isn't safe here anymore.@0003
There's no sense in continuing
this fight!@0003
We need to run!@0003@000BAgreed, they'll be sending
more soldiers soon.@0003
@000DWe should get going.@0003
Now.@0003
@000D@0010@0104@000AI know a spot,
but it's not glamorous.@0003
@0008You mean the graveyard?@0003
It's certainly off the beaten path,
doubt anyone would expect to go there.@0003
@000B ... Not sure how I feel about it,@0003
but I don't think we have much
of a choice now.@0003
Is there really no other option?@0003
@000AWouldn't chance it on any
of the towns.@0003
If Gradin's after you like you said,
there's little doubt in my mind@0003
he'd turn over every stone to look for you.
Gross as it may be,@0003
the graveyard's likely for the best.@0003
@0008Sri's right, for once.@0003
@000APah!@0003
@0008Tee hee.@0003
@000DLet's go then. 
Storch, let's rally everyone.@0003
@000BRight, guess we better
make a run for it.@0003
Grab what you can and move out!@0003
# 0x0D8B
@0009@0010@0131@0009What's the big idea?@0003
This territory belongs to my gang!@0003
You're tryna take what's mine!@0003
@0009@0011@000B@0010@0105@000B
I'm sorry,@0003
I didn't realize you owned the
merchant caravan.@0003
I guess that makes us
the bandits here.@0003
@000B@0011@0009@0010@0131@0009Yeah!
That's right!@0003
Wait, what?@0003
# 0x0D8C
@0009@0010@0131@0009This was supposed
to be easy. Why are you@0003
getting in my way?@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0102@000CStealing from the merchants
isn't right.@0003
I've gotta do what's right!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0131@0009Oh ho!@0003
The brigand thinks he's part
of the Imperial Guard?@0003
Pah!@0003
I'll put you in the dirt!@0003

Our story begins in the town
of Rask, a hamlet near the coast,@0003
in the State of Belaro.@0003
Storch, son of a farmer,  is joined
by his companions to discuss@0003
their course of action in 
these trying times.@0003
# 0x0D96
A successful haul soiled by being seen
by a high ranking soldier of Lord Gradin,@0003
Storch and team lay low for a few weeks.@0003
With no disturbances, but money once
again running low,@0003
Storch and his team plan their next mission.@0003
It would be here where their morality
would truly be tested...@0003
# 0x0D97
Storch and team rest easy after
accidentally saving the merchant caravan@0003
they initially sought to assault.@0003
However, they had not only made enemies
of the state, but now of a prominent
bandit group in the area.@0003 
It would turn out that this particular
group was not to be taken lightly.@0003
# 0x0D98
Storch's homecoming visit is cut short 
by tense relations with his father.@0003
With his younger brother in tow,
Storch and team head north@0003
to Port Irene looking for a clue on 
where they can find their next score.@0003
Port Irene is a sleepy port by Nevanese 
standards, but is one of the critical centers@0003
of commerce in the State of Belaro.@0003
Gradin's harsh taxation has made trade
come to a near standstill,@0003
as merchants begin to take their 
wares elsewhere.@0003
Even still, it is a prime target for bandits
not only on land, but at sea...@0003
# 0x0D99
Storch escapes Port Irene after liberating
the town from the pirates.@0003
While Gradin's right-hand, Lesley, 
hunts down Storch as a criminal,@0003
the townspeople see a hero, fighting off
the bandits that plague Belaro,@0003
and know they are mislabeled and 
wrongfully hunted by Gradin.@0003
Tales of Storch's exploits spread 
through Belaro,@0003
as a rallying cry for change behind
the "Hero of Port Irene".@0003
However, the team, per Nazar's suggestion,
decides to lay low in the quiet hamlet@0003
of Ouromov.@0003
The group takes a needed reprieve,
for a few weeks,@0003
but it would not be safe for too long...@0003
# 0x0D9A
Storch's hideout has been found,@0003
and they engage in a late night rumble
with Gradin's forces.@0003
Narrowly escaping,@0003
the team look to find a safe haven
to recuperate.@0003
Their new companions, Dewi and Sri, 
suggest a graveyard near the coast.@0003
This graveyard houses the bodies of fallen
Nevanese soldiers from great wars@0003
in years past.@0003
Much like how those wars
were lost to history,@0003
so too was the location of this
forsaken place to many,@0003
and the few that do remember, still remain...@0003

While it'll be our resting place, 
let's hope it isn't our final one.@0003
@000COh hush you, 
don't scare them off.@0003
It's bad enough we
have to come back here.@0003
@000DI kid, sister. 
Loosen up a little bit.@0003
It feels just like 
old times being here.@0003
@0009Don't sweat it,
this place will be fine,@0003
so long as it's safe.@0003
I take it you both have
spent a lot of time here?@0003
@000C... More than we'd
like to admit.@0003
@0008It seems peculiar for travelers
from Kuching to make residence@0003
at a forgotten graveyard from
the ancient wars.@0003
Tell me, who are you both, really?@0003
@0009Esfir!@0003
@0008Storch, you can't be so trusting.@0003
They're hiding something from us.
This whole thing feels suspicious.@0003
@0009Dewi and Sri helped us when
they had no reason to,@0003
hasn't that earned them
your trust, Esfir?@0003
It was just like when Natsuko
showed up when we fought@0003
the bandits.@0003
@0008This is different.@0003
While they helped us,
they have not been forthcoming.@0003
@000C... I can understand why
you feel that way.@0003
Brother, shall we tell them?@0003
@000DWhat?
Now you want to tell them?@0003
Good grief, Dewi. 
Make up your damn mind.@0003
Given the circumstances,@0003
I don't think we have much
choice anyhow.@0003
@000CRight. I'm sorry, Esfir.@0003
My brother and I are not travelers.
We're fugitives.@0003 
@0008... Go on.@0003
@000C ... Right.@0003
So, not violent criminals or anything
like that.@0003
I'll at least assure you that 
before I get into it.@0003 
But tell me, how much do you
both know about where@0003
we come from?@0003
Our home, Kuching?@0003
@0009Not much.@0003
Eastern Nevan, and Belaro especially,,
is a bit isolated.@0003
My brother used to work as
a soldier at the border where@0003
Mahalan ships sailed in,@0003
but we seldom got news from@0003
lands further west than the 
capitol. Esfir, what about you?@0003
@0008I was born in Western Nevan,
so I'm a bit more familiar with Kuching.@0003
They do not have a government,@0003
but instead are a loose federation@0003
of tribes that inhabit the plains
and rolling hills to the west of Nevan@0003
and the east of the forest that
leads into Mostyn.@0003
Orebro, the holy theocracy, 
shares its southern border@0003
with Kuching, while the Kingdom 
of Freyung's northern border@0003
touches Kuching's southern. 
It is a crossroads of the western part@0003
of the continent and thus a place with
greats strife as many pass through it.@0003
I know that while Nevan and Kuching
historically have had rough relations,@0003
Kuching's close relations with Mostyn
have forced Nevan to think more@0003
critically about flexing its muscles there.@0003
There's a lot of money to be 
made by owning the trade routes,@0003
which is why both sides have
an interest there.@0003
@000DThat's not a bad description.@0003
@0009I didn't know you knew
so much about it, Esfir.@0003
@0008Let's just say I've 
traveled around a fair bit.@0003
@0009Mhm...
Anyway, please continue.@0003
@000CAgreed. Don't be fooled though,@0003
there are plenty of trade routes 
through Kuching,@0003
but that wealth does not cross
the palms of most Kuchingi.@0003
Our people live a minimalist 
and nomadic lifestyle.@0003
Many take what they need
from the land and nothing more.@0003
We're generally into
the "old ways", of living.@0003 
@000DBasically, 
everyone is broke and hungry.@0003 
@000CMore or less the case,
even if my brother exaggerates it@0003 
@0009So you stole.@0003
@000CYes. Sri, myself,
and a few others assaulted@0003
a caravan, but it turned out to
be a supply train from Mostyn.@0003
We thought it was a merchant 
from Nevan.@0003
Soldiers from Mostyn retaliated.@0003
@000COur comrades got captured
or killed, Dewi and I managed to escape,@0003
but we knew Kuching wouldn't be safe.@0003
Mostyn and Kuching have cozied up
as Esfir said, they have a strong@0003
interest in ensuring that Nevan
doesn't get closer to their doorstep.@0003
We originally figured Mahala would be
a good place to hide,@0003
as many of our ancestors made 
the journey centuries ago,@0003
but Belaro's been pretty good to us. 
Low-key and mellow, a seaside breeze,@0003 
what's not to like?@0003
@000CWe were still planning 
on going to Mahala,@0003
but we also didn't want to starve,@0003
so we've been mulling around
here for a while.@0003 
But does that answer your question?@0003
@0009Works for me. 
We're not too different.@0003 
@0008Indeed. I apologize
for questioning you, but it had@0003
to be done.@0003
Please forgive my 
interrogation.@0003
@000DWe've dealt with worse.@0003
Look, I'd love to grab an ale 
and swap tales of life on the run,@0003 
but it looks like we're not alone here.@0003
Did you see that? 
Someone's lurking there in the shadows.@0003
@0009What? Who's there?@0003
@000DCome out if you know 
what's good for you.@0003
...@0003
...@0003
Damn, 
it's too dark here.@0003 
I can't see too far at all!@0003
@0009Stay together, everyone!@0003 
It looks like we have company.@0003
# 0x0D9E
@0009@0010@0134@000C@0010@0144It appears we have been found.@0003
@0009They look like nothing but
a band of petty thieves.@0003
They won't know who we are 
or what we are doing.@0003 
This is a graveyard after all. 
A fitting end, wouldn't you say?@0003
@000CIndeed.@0003 
We cannot let them leave
having seen us.@0003 
It is too risky.@0003
@0009Let's bury them.@0003
@000CI think I may have
a better use for them...@0003
# 0x0D9F
@0008@0010@0104@000A@0010@0102@000B@0010@010F@000D@0010@0110Whoever they were, 
they did not want us to find out.@0003
@000BThey didn't look like 
graverobbers either.@0003
@000AYeah, this whole encounter
spooked me out.@0003
I just hope we can get some sleep now.@0003 
Man, what I would do for my old bed!@0003
@0008Storch,@0003
perhaps it's time we tried to head 
back to Rask?@0003
@000AWhat? Really?@0003
@0008We need to get out of here@0003
Everywhere we turn, we find ourselves
embroiled in a conflict,@0003
whether it be with arrogant soldiers,
brigands, or bizarre cultists.@0003
It may be good for us 
to regroup at home.@0003
@000AMaybe you're right...@0003
I guess we don't have much choice.
We'll head to Rask.@0003
Dewi, Sri, will you be coming?@0003
@000DAin't got nowhere
else to be, right sister?@0003
@000BSadly true... Yes,
we will come with you.@0003
Thanks for having us, Storch.@0003
People in Western Nevan tend
to look down on us Kuchingi,@0003
and think we are beneath them.@0003
You and your comrades...
I sense no such hostility.@0003
@000AIgnorance is bliss, right?@0003
Something to be said about only
knowing about what's right@0003
in front of you.@0003
You're like me, who cares
which patch of soil you were@0003
born on? You've earned my trust.@0003
@000BAnd mine too. Let's go.@0003@0008....@0003
# 0x0DA0
Meanwhile, in Castle Belaro...
Lord Gradin and General Lesley@0003
meet to discuss the current
state of affairs.@0003
# 0x0DA1
@0009@0010@014C@000C@0010@0139So they got away again,
is it?@0003
@0009We sent a troop to engage them, 
and Houston was unable.@0003
to capture them.@0003 
We suspect that they have
moved further south.@0003 
@000CI see... @0003
I tire of this, Lesley.@0003 
The people are getting riled up
over this Hero of Port Irene.@0003
Pah!@0003
Nothing but an ape playing a 
game of swords and princesses.@0003
A hero, how vain.@0003
@0009Indeed, Lord Gradin.@0003
@000CWe cannot have the people 
rebelling against me.@0003 
It would be most unpleasant
to deal with this,@0003
especially with the Emperor
visiting in the coming weeks.@0003
@0009Indeed, Lord Gradin.@0003
@000CLesley, I will not accept failure again.@0003 
Your are my general,@0003 
and a general must reflect the 
strength of her leader.@0003
And that is something I do not see.@0003
@0009Indeed, Lord Gradin.@0003
@000CNow go.@0003
I'll be in my chambers. 
Guards! Attend me!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0011
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0111
Did you hear that, Helga?@0003
@0009Every word, Lord Titus. 
Tell me, what are you scheming?@0003
@000CI want to see this Hero
of Port Irene myself.@0003

That doesn't sound good...@0003

@000DHey Owen, it is.@0003
Marlen is here too.@0003
@0008Good,@0003
I'm glad you're both here.@0003
I assume you're here
because you heard the news?@0003
@000DWhat news?@0003
@000BAre our parents okay, Owen?@0003
@0008... Well, I hate to be the one 
to break it to you boys.@0003
but your parents were taken 
prisoner for not paying their taxes.@0003
They took a few other folks from 
here and the neighboring towns.@0003
@000DWhat? Those dastards...@0003
Gradin raises the taxes to an 
obscene rate,@0003
and then punishes people 
who cannot afford it!@0003
@000BMom... 
Dad...@0003 
Where are they taken?@0003
@0008Your guess is as good as mine, boy,@0003
but word has it the jailer is 
one of Gradin's men.@0003
They've been taking folks 
up north to Gradin's manse.@0003
@000DTo Castle Belaro... 
When did they get taken?@0003
@0008Yesterday. Now boy,@0003
I know what you're thinking, 
but it's too dangerous!@0003
We'll get the money together 
to get them out.@0003
@000DBut what will happen after we 
get them out and we have nothing?@0003
What's to stop them from
doing this again?@0003
No, this has to end now.@0003
I've been running around for
months, and all it's brought@0003
is more grief for all of us.@0003
We've proven we can fight
and hang with the best of 'em,@0003
And this...
This puts me over the edge.@0003
I got into this to protect
my family... And I've failed,@0003
But I'm gonna make things right.
And if I can't, I'll die trying!@0003
@000BBrother... @0003
@0008You're a fiery one, Storch.@0003
You remind me a bit of your older brother.@0003 
I've heard rumors about your exploits too, 
and the run-ins you've had.@0003
@000DSo which story do you believe?@0003
Am I a fugitive, or am I a hero?@0003
@000BWe're not fugitives!@0003
We're just trying to do what we can!@0003
Right, brother?@0003
@0008Boy, I know you're no thief.@0003
The people aren't trusting of Gradin, 
at least those with any common sense.@0003 
Look, I'm not going to stop you
if you want to go,@0003
but remember to stay safe.@0003
If you want to challenge Gradin 
head on and liberate Belaro,@0003 
that's your prerogative.
I see you've assembled quite@0003
a force of soldiers here,
and I'm sure more will join you.@0003
All I ask is that you don't die.@0003 
Don't let your parents feel that pain again.@0003 @000DI won't...@0003
Thanks Owen.@0003
Family...@0003
Family is really important, isn't it?@0003 
We wouldn't be doing any of this 
if it weren't for them.@0003@000BWe're doing it together.
brother!@0003
I know you're tired and stressed,
but I know that together,@0003
we can save mom and dad!@0003@000DThat's right...@0003
As much as I don't want to do this, 
if we're going to do it,@0003 
we should do it together.@0003 
Owen, will you join us?@0003
@0008Ha! You've got guts, boy.
I'll give you that.@0003
My axe arm isn't what it used to be.@0003 
To get into a good brawl again, 
it is my dream. But I'm too old now,@0003
I can't do it. 
I've gotta manage the shop.@0003 
Least I can do is help you stock up.@0003 
@000BAw heck, Owen.@0003
That's real nice of you!@0003
Brother, do we really think
we can liberate Belaro?@0003

@000DMarlen, I'm about as mad as 
I've ever been.@0003 
I can feel my hands shaking.@0003
There's nothing more I want
to do than punch Gradin in the face,@0003
But more importantly, we gotta get
our parents back safe.@0003
If the only way to do that is to fight him
head on, then that's what we@0003
gotta do. It's cut and dry to me.@0003
This whole time I've been trying 
to survive, focusing as much as@0003
I can on that. But now....@0003
now we've proven we can't
keep doing the same thing.@0003
We've gotta take the fight
to them.@0003
I'd rather die fighting
than live knowing I could've@0003
done more. If this journey 
has taught me anything,@0003
it's that.@0003
Let's get everyone together, 
looks like we are are on our way, again.@0003

@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@012D@0009Wait, Storch.@0003
Before you go. 
I have a favor to ask you.@0003
@000CHuh? What is it?@0003
@0009Look after Larisa.@0003
My daughter is tough as nails,
but she's the only family I have left.@0003 
I know you and her don't speak much,@0003
but I don't think she'd be doing
this if she wasn't interested@0003 
in patching things up.@0003
@000C... Right.@0003
@0009I'm not asking you to make amends. 
Look,@0003
I don't really care about the dramas 
of teenage romance,@0003 
but just don't let whatever 
happened between you two@0003
all those years ago 
cloud your judgment, alright?.@0003
@000CI won't.@0003
@0009Good.@0003 
I'm going to go chat with her 
before you head off.@0003 
Storch, remember what I said.
Don't die on us,@0003
and give 'em hell.@0003
@000CI won't forget.@0003
# 0x0DA7
@0009@0010@010A@000C@0010@012DLarisa. Are you well?@0003
@0009Father! I am.@0003
I'm glad to see you're safe.@0003 
@000CI spoke with Storch,@0003
and he's going to fight back
to save his parents.@0003 
Are you going with him?@0003
@0009Yes...@0003
I don't really know why I kept fighting
after that bandit attack.@0003 
A woman such as myself, a fugitive?@0003
It doesn't sit well at all.@0003 
Oh father, I'm conflicted. 
It all used to be so easy,@0003
now every decision weighs 
on me like a stone.@0003 
Tell me, does it get easier? 
Will it ever be like how it was?@0003
@000CThings will get better.@0003
They get worse sometimes, 
but we're always moving forward,@0003 
even if it takes us longer than we'd like, 
or if the path isn't as clear.@0003 
Part of growing up is being able
to accept that uncertainty.@0003
@0009You're right...@0003
Father,
I will continue to fight.@0003
I have come so far... 
It'll only get easier, right?@0003
@000CIt does.@0003
You've grown right before
my eyes into a fine woman,@0003
Larisa. 
You've got your mother's resolve.@0003
I can see it in your eyes.@0003
@0009Father...@0003
@000CNever mind all that.@0003
Just a father getting sentimental 
about his girl growing up on him.@0003
But before you go, 
I want to give you this.@0003
I made it for you.@0003
@0009This spear... it's beautiful.@0003
Father, I simply cannot accept
such generosity!@0003
@000CLook, I can't fight alongside you.@0003
It pains me that I cannot.@0003
Take this in my stead.@0003
@0009Alright... thank you, Father.@0003
@000CYou're welcome, Larisa. 
Don't let anyone get in your way.@0003 
Choke every point with pride.@0003
Please be safe.@0003

Sounds like serious business.@0003
What happened to the 
quiet life at home?@0003
@000DI'd spend it regretting not
taking any action to help my family.@0003
I know my dad is a stubborn mule, 
but he's my father all the same.@0003 
I gotta help him.@0003 
@000AYou're more mature than most, Storch.@0003
I give you credit.@0003
But challenging Gradin?@0003
We are already his enemy, 
and our numbers are small.@0003
We should really consider escaping-@0003
@000DNo, I can't run anymore Esfir.@0003
Running these past few months, heck,@0003
I'm tuckered out and not getting anywhere.
My parents were taken by Gradin,@0003
Esfir, 
I can't just run away to save myself.@0003
We've won our battles so far... 
But this next one may be our toughest yet.@0003
@0008Storch... We are with you
to the end.@0003
@000BStorch!@0003
I told you, they're gonna
tell stories about us!@0003
This may be the most exciting
chapter of that tale.@0003
Just think...@0003
Storch, the Hero of Port Irene,
nay, the Hero of Belaro!@0003
Joined by his loyal pals,
Vagelis, the stone golem,@0003
Esfir, the dagger in the shadows,@0003
and Arckady, the handsome!@0003
@0008Cousin, you're wrong..@0003
Surely your looks won't be
what you are remembered for.@0003
@000BVagelis!@0003
You snake in the grass,
you wound me!@0003
That's no way to talk to 
someone whose gonna@0003
end this reign of terror!@0003
Do you know what
they'd say about you?!@0003
They'd say "Remember Vagelis? He 
used his bow to attack from far away,@0003
he stood by idly as his handsome cousin,@0003 
Arckady, deftly vanquished
the enemy!!"@0003
@0008Unlikely.@0003
@000ALet's not waste time 
speculating. We need to act.@0003
Storch.
We're all here, let's go.@0003
@000DRight. Let's go.@0003
# 0x0DA9
Storch arrives home to learn
that his parents have been taken@0003
by Lord Gradin's men@0003
for failure to pay their taxes.@0003
Storch knows now there is no way
getting around this,@0003
and that he must face the enemy
head on.@0003
Owen, Larisa's father, tells Storch
that the prisoners are heading north,@0003
towards Castle Belaro.@0003
The group makes haste
and manages to catch up to the enemy@0003
in one of the most dense
forests in all of Nevan...@0003
# 0x0DAA
@0009@0010@015C@000C@0010@0136@000CKeep at it, men!@0003
We're well on our way 
to the castle now,@0003
and we'll all get to 
have a strong ale@0003
and perhaps a hand with some of@0003 
the prisoners before Lord Gradin
has his turn.@0003 
@0009You're despicable.@0003
Don't harm the women, you dastard!@0003
@000CListen, worm.@0003
You're lucky you're still standing. 
And in fact, your luck has run out.@0003
@0009Urk! Gwah... No...@0003
@0009@0011
@000CLet this be a warning for you all!@0003
I am Cruller, the jailer.@0003
The gods fear my name!@0003
Anyone captured by me will be blessed@0003
with my presence for the
rest of their days.@0003
Enjoy your fresh air, boys and girls,
because this is the last@0003
you'll have for the rest of
your pathetic lives!@0003

@000CQuiet down!@0003
Keep talking and the words 
you utter will be your last@0003.
@0009Don't instigate them, dear.@0003
We'll be fine.@0003
Just keep your head down
and don't cause trouble...@0003

We've been spotted.@0003
@000ADamn...@0003
Look at that armor,@0003
is he from the capitol?
This'll be tough...@0003
@0008He's flying alone,@0003
I don't think he's the enemy. 
Vagelis, lower your bow.@0003
@000DI'm not lowering until
I know for sure.@0003
@0009He's landing...@0003
looks like he's coming to talk to us. 
What could this be all about?@0003
@000B@0010@0116Yawn...@0003 
@000AUh, hello?@0003
@000BSorry, I should introduce myself.@0003
I'm Ruslan.@0003
You're Storch, aren't you?@0003
@000AYeah, what of it?@0003
@000BHm, they make you 
out to look a lot tougher.@0003
@000A... Is that all you have to say? 
You do realize you're outnumbered, right?@0003 
@000BThey did seem to get
your temperament right.@0003 
I'm not your enemy.@0003 
I was from the imperial army, 
they sent me and a few others@0003
to support suppressing your rebellion.@0003
But the life of a soldier isn't for me.@0003
It's a lot of work, 
always oppressing townspeople and all that.@0003
It's just not really my thing.@0003
I wanted to be a border guard
and have a relaxing life.@0003
@000ASo you deserted?@0003
@000BYawn...@0003
Yeah,@0003
I didn't want to stick around any longer
than I needed to.@0003 
I slipped away and have been
traveling around.@0003
Money's a little low,@0003
so I'm looking to make some coin
so I can go back to drifting around@0003 
the continent with my pal Papilion, here.@0003
@000AI see... Guess I'm not really in
a place to refuse your help.@0003 
We'll discuss pay after we get
out of this.@0003

@000DStorch!@0003

stuffed into these caravans.@0003 
@000DThese jail caravans, 
my god, this is inhumane.@0003
And that stench... @0003
how is anyone surviving the 
journey around Belaro in@0003
these conditions? There's 
even a few bodies...@0003
@000AMom... Dad...@0003

@000BMarlen? Storch?@0003 
What are you doing here?@0003
Oh heavens, 
I'm thankful you're both safe.@0003
@000AAw heck mom.@0003
How do you think we feel?@0003
Even in jail, you're worried 
about us.@0003
@000BIt's a mother's duty 
to care about her children, isn't it?@0003 
I did not expect to be freed by 
our own sons of course,@0003
what exactly is going on?@0003
Why is there an army here?@0003 
@000DYou both have a lot of explaining to do,@0003
your mother and I were worried 
sick about you, Marlen.@0003 
Leaving without a word to join up
with your scheming brother?@0003 
What are you doing fighting Gradin's men?@0003
@000AScheming brother?@0003 
Dad, you realized this is Storch, 
your son, who saved you!@0003 
He lead the attack on the jailer
to set you all free.@0003 
No one is gonna go to jail for 
stupid taxes anymore.@0003
Dad, we're gonna liberate Belaro!@0003
@000DLiberate Belaro?@0003 
Is that the kinds of ideas that boy has?
What has he done to my sensible son...@0003
@000B...@0003
@000ADad, what are you saying?@0003
You're bearing witness to what 
happens when Gradin gets his way!@0003 
We want to change that.@0003
@000DBah, you young kids 
and your ideals.@0003 
You only think of what could be 
rather than what is.@0003 
What about your own life?@0003
You'd throw that away?@0003 
@000BDear, please, stop. @0003
You're upsetting me.@0003
@000DStay out of this.@0003 
Marlen, why are you betraying 
your homeland?@0003 
You should be at home, 
finishing your studies.@0003 
@000ADad!@0003
I-I...@0003
@0008Dad, leave him alone.@0003
Marlen's old enough to make
his own choices.@0003
@000DStorch.@0003
What are you doing?@0003
Playing heroes and knights
with your band of miscreants?@0003
Just what is this all about?@0003
@0008It's about a lot of things,@0003 
but it's a pity you can't seem to see 
past how I tried to support you.@0003 
Do you realize what we just 
did to try and save you?@0003 
Do you realize how much I try 
to make your lives@0003
a little bit easier? How much I 
try to be a good son@0003
to you and Mom?@0003
How I try to make up for 
what happened to Augstyn...@0003
@000DDon't bring your brother
into this, Storch.@0003
@0008Alright.@0003 
Then let's make it about you.@0003
@000AStorch, 
don't get into an argument with him.@0003
Let's just go home.@0003
@000BMarlen's right, dear,@0003 
what are you even upset over? 
Augustyn is gone. It pains me,@0003 
but you have to move on. 
You have two other sons,@0003 
both of whom are fine men 
that just saved us from jail.@0003
@000DThey broke the law!@0003 
They're going to be in jail next 
if they keep doing this.@0003 
I don't want to see all three of 
my children die before me!@0003
@0008Stubborn old man...@0003
You'd rather rot in jail
so we don't have to.@0003 
@000DMuch like your mother's duty, it's
also a father's duty to care, Storch.@0003
Which is why I'm hard on you boys.@0003
And it's also why I 
wholeheartedly disapprove of this.@0003
@0008 ... Alright.@0003
I think I understand you now, dad. 
I'm not going to argue with you.@0003 
You and Mom are free now. 
I know I can't make you agree@0003
with me and the choices I've made, 
but know that everything I did@0003 
was for the family. 
And my choice now,@0003
to fight against Lord Gradin, 
is also for the sake of our family.@0003 
If you want to try and shield me 
and Marlen for your own sake,@0003 
what good is it if we're all going to
be too destitute to enjoy our bond?@0003 
For now, we must fight. 
And heck, I'd like to return back@0003
to the way things were when 
this is all over, if you'd have me.@0003
@000DBoy... You're mule-headed like 
your father, alright.@0003 
I don't approve of this, 
but I'm not going to try and stop you.@0003 
You're an adult now and can 
make your own choices...@0003 
I'm sorry for acting how I did.@0003
I guess I was reconciling with my boys
growing up and not needing their@0003
father anymore. Before your mother
and I moved to Belaro, I was a soldier@0003
and saw a lot of my friends, good men,@0003
all die. I didn't want you to have to live
through that, so we became farmers.@0003
When Augustyn died, those dark
emotions resurfaced, and I didn't@0003
know how to handle it. I became 
worried, overprotective, overbearing...@0003
You probably think I'm some
ignorant old man, and maybe you're@0003
right. But you're my sons, and we're
a family. We need to be able to@0003
work through our differences.
And maybe I wasn't willing to.@0003
You're both welcome back
whenever you like. @0003
@000AI know that is 
what Augustyn would want too!@0003
@0008Indeed... Thanks dad.@0003

What for?@0003

of speaking with today,
milord?@0003
@000AHm, pay no mind to
your manners, Storch.@0003 
Manners of the court can 
be learned.@0003 
I am Lord Titus, 
son of the deceased@0003
Lord Vespasian, and 
nephew to Lord Gradin.@0003 
This is Helga, 
my trusted bodyguard.@0003 
@000BWell met.@0003
@0008Pleasure.@0003
@000AAnd it is met well indeed, 
Storch.@0003 
For I am sure you are 
wondering why we are here.@0003
@000BYeah, normally I'd be 
skeptical of Gradin's family@0003 
showing up like this,@0003
but you came only with a 
single soldier to meet us,@0003 
and only a small force behind.@0003 
You're not my enemy.@0003
@000AYou learn fast, Storch. 
That's correct.@0003
@000BBut why?@0003 
@000AMy father was killed by
Lord Gradin, and the assassination@0003 
was covered up.@0003 
You see, Storch, my father 
was also a man of the people,@0003 
and did not agree with Gradin 
on the heavy taxes levied@0003
on the people.@0003
Fearing a loss of influence, 
my father was slain before@0003 
he could rally troops of his own.@0003
The public however, is unaware.@0003
The story they were fed was
a farce. The truth remains in darkness.@0003
@000BWas that his intent though, 
to rebel?@0003
@000AThat I do not know.@0003 
My father was both smart
and cunning,@0003 
had he wanted to, 
I'm sure he would've been@0003 
able to do so.@0003 
But Gradin appeared to be 
more worried about the@0003 
potentiality of a rebellion.@0003
He knows his grip on 
Belaro is weak.@0003
A cornered beast will
strike back in desperation.@0003
@000DI had heard that 
Lord Vespasian's death was foul play.@0003 
But for it to be true... 
It all makes more sense now.@0003
@000BHow do you know
this is for sure?@0003
If he knew you knew,
wouldn't he murder you too?@0003
@000AAn astute observation,
my dear Storch!@0003
For your first question, 
let's say I have my sources.@0003
To your second, he does not.@0003
While it pains me that the truth
behind my father's death@0003
is lost on the populace,
but I know that much like@0003
the sun and the moon,
the truth will not be@0003
hidden for long.@0003 
@000BSo that's why you
want to fight Lord Gradin,@0003 
isn't it? Revenge?@0003
@000ARevenge...@0003 
I'd only be fooling myself if I 
did not claim it a reason for this,@0003 
but I too, Storch, wish to be a 
man of the people.@0003 
I see the suffering, 
I... understand the pain.@0003 
I want to make Belaro a 
better place for us all.@0003 
When I heard your story, 
I was moved.@0003 
A common man from a 
farm rising up with his friends@0003 
to take on a corrupt power?@0003
It is straight from tales of old, 
myths, and legends.@0003 
@000BI see... 
So you really think I have a shot?@0003 
I didn't get into any of this 
business with the intent@0003 
of liberating Belaro, 
I just want things to go@0003 
back to how they were. 
If Gradin's gotta go for@0003 
that to happen,@0003 
I guess I'm gonna 
have to keep fighting.@0003 
@000ANoble and unselfsh, 
trademarks of a real hero!@0003 
And yes, I do think we have more
than just a shot, Storch.@0003 
I have studied both magic and war 
for many years.@0003 
I'd like to be your tactician 
and join in the fight.@0003 
Helga, of course, is not 
someone you'd like to meet@0003 
on the battlefield, either.@0003 
@0008Tch. Just get on with it.@0003
@000AReady to cut to the meat 
of the issue, as always!@0003
So then, Storch, will you accept
us into your ranks?@0003 
Together, with our combined forces,
we can take on Lord Gradin,@0003 
end the corrupt tax policy, 
and liberate Belaro!@0003 
We will become the 
envy of Nevan,@0003 
nay, the continent!@0003
@000BThis all seems so sudden.
What if this is a trap?@0003
@000AAnd it is right of you 
to think so, Storch.@0003 
But perhaps we can earn your 
full trust if you place@0003
just a little in us upfront?@0003
Our goals are one in the same,
and our skillsets are natural@0003
complements, are they not?@0003
@000BHm... I get it.@0003 
As we get closer to Gradin,@0003 
your knowledge about the 
region will only be more helpful.@0003 
I don't think many of us here have 
spent much time in the area.@0003
Plus, I bet you know a whole
lot about how the army works.@0003
I've picked up a thing or two
from our scuffles,@0003
but I don't know much about
the bigger battles we're gonna face.@0003
@000ASplendid.@0003
My dear Storch, it appears 
that a fruitful partnership@0003 
is upon us.@0003 
And you are most shrewd indeed, 
for this area is my homeland,@0003 
and I know it quite well.@0003 
That is why I suggest we take 
the battle to Gradin directly.@0003 
There is a stronghold not 
too far from here.@0003 
He would not expect us to 
take the offensive given@0003
the size of our forces.@0003 
With all of your exploits of late, 
you would gather much@0003 
support from the citzenry for
your actions, leaving us with-@0003
@000BLook, that all sounds great
and all, but I want to tend@0003 
to the prisoners first. 
Lord Titus,@0003 
could you lend a hand?@0003
@000APrisoners?@0003 
Hm? Ah. Yes... 
Alright, I can assist.@0003
@000BGood. Esfir, can you 
help them?@0003 
I'm going back to see my parents.@0003
@000D...@0003
@000A...@0003
@000BEsfir?@0003
@000D ... Yes. Milady, 
milord, please come this way.@0003
# 0x0DAE
@000C@0010@0136An enemy approaches?@0003
Who would be enough of a
dotard to challenge me?@0003
They must be here to free
the prisoners...@0003
Alright men! Bring the 
prisoners out!@0003
Use them as shields! 
Mua ha!@0003
Let's see their faces
when they must slay@0003
those they wish to save!@0003
I'm sure Gradin won't mind
the losses when we bring him@0003
the heads of the cretins who
dare to oppose his will!@0003
Kill them all!@0003 
# 0x0DAF
Storch liberates the prisoners from 
the cruel grasp of the jailer Cruller,@0003
and is joined by Lord Titus and his 
stern bodyguard, Helga.@0003
Lord Titus is the nephew of Lord Gradin,
seeking revenge for the assassination@0003
of his late father, Lord Vespasian.@0003
With a small force of his own,@0003
he asks for Storch to lend
his support to their cause.@0003
With Titus' knowledge of warfare and
legitimacy to the throne of Belaro,@0003
and Storch with his broad appeal,@0003
are a natural pair for the 
mission ahead.@0003 
Word of this allegiance spreads 
far in Belaro and beyond,@0003
and support for his cause continues. 
With the wind to their back, Titus@0003
suggests taking the offensive and 
launching an assault on a@0003 
strategically critical fort for 
Castle Belaro.@0003 
Storch, reluctantly, 
prepares for the assault...@0003
# 0x0DB0
@0009@0010@0140@000C@0010@0139Emperor Festan,
Belaro welcomes you.@0003
I trust your accommodations have been
satisfactory, Your Highness?@0003
@0009Well met, Lord Gradin.@0003 
Indeed they are.@0003
But these are not times for pleasantries,
and tea time talk.@0003
Let me cut to the point.@0003
I have heard much about the 
disturbances in Belaro.@0003
Lord Vespasian's death...@0003
A ragtag band of farmer rebelling, 
seeking to end your rule...@0003
Your nephew, Lord Titus, 
joining their cause...@0003
It seems you have much 
on your plate, Lord Gradin.@0003
@000C ... The situation is under control.@0003 
@0009 Indeed. I trust the soldiers 
I've sent to join your forces@0003
will help you keep it under control, then.@0003
@000CIndeed, Your Highness.@0003 
They will be most useful in 
quelling this... minor disturbance.@0003 
@0009See to it.@0003 
The prisoners you have at Castle Belaro,@0003
I will be taking them back with
me to the capitol.@0003 
I was expecting more from you, Lord Gradin.@0003 
You know that these criminals 
must be punished.@0003
@000CYes, indeed, Your Majesty.@0003 
I will be sure to make up for
it by your next visit.@0003
@0009Words are empty.@0003
Might I remind you, Lord Gradin, 
that I do not care who sits on@0003
the throne of Belaro.@0003
So long as the Lord of the State
is able to provide for the Empire.@0003
@000CI will remember that, 
Your Highness.@0003
@0009That would be for the best.@0003
Now then, I must be heading back
to the Capitol.@0003 
I expect more prisoners on my next
visit. When you capture the rebels,@0003
send them to me. They will receive
their judgment there with the others.@0003
Do not fail me, Lord Gradin.@0003
Remember the outcome if you do.@0003
@000CIndeed, Your Majesty.
I shall not fail.@0003
With the might of General Bromhilda,
coupled with Belaro's finest,@0003
you have nothing to fear.@0003
@0009Hmph. Farewell.@0003
@0009@0011
@000CThe Emperor...@0003 
Something is afoul, here.@0003 
Why does he need the prisoners?@0003
The high taxes are the easiest 
way to get prisoners,@0003
but it also threatens my authority.@0003
What seemed foolproof has proven
to be most costly...@0003
However, I am promised a hefty sum 
for the prisoners...@0003 
but will it be worth it?@0003 
Of course it is, I shouldn't be 
questioning that, no.@0003 
No, definitely not.@0003
But I cannot fail. 
I am the finest ruler Belaro@0003
has ever seen. I will bring
Emperor Festan the criminals he seeks.@0003
# 0x0DB1
@0009@0010@014CThat didn't look like it went well.@0003 
I've never seen him like this... 
There is more going on here.@0003
@000C@0010@0142@000CIs something amiss, General Lesley?@0003
@0009It is not my station to think, General Bromhilda,@0003 
but I do make my observations time and again.
Excuse me for speaking so openly.@0003
@000CPeace, General Lesley.@0003 
While I am an Imperial General from the capitol,
I am fighting under your banner.@0003
I am Lord Gradin's to command.@0003
@0009You're quite kind, General.@0003 
Whatever is going on is not my concern. 
We are soldiers,@0003 
loyal to the end.@0003 
@000C... Indeed.@0003
General Lesley, please excuse me.
I will see to my troops,@0003
Do not hesitate to call me
if I am needed.@0003@0009Yes. My men will see to it
that their rations are sent,@0003
and their accommodations are made.@0003
Please, take your rest.
We will discuss our plans@0003
on the morrow in the war council.@0003@000CUntil then, General.@0003@000C@0011@000B@0010@0118@000D@0010@0119@0009Zoya. Hollace.@0003@000BSister, er, General Lesley.@0003
What is it?@0003@0009Lord Titus has betrayed us.@0003
He has joined the enemy and 
fights alongside the brigand, Storch.@0003@000CWhat?1 Lord Titus...
But why?@0003
@0009Sister, I am unsure.
In fact, I have never been so unsure.@0003
Between you and I, this situation
concerns me greatly.@0003
Not only for Belaro, but for all of Nevan.
But for now, we wait.@0003
Tomorrow, I will meet with 
General Bromhilda from the capitol@0003
to devise a strategy to take them
down. With Lord Titus, they are@0003
a serious threat to Lord Belaro.@0003
Get some rest, I don't want you
two out of commission for this.@0003
We will need every able soldier.@0003
@000BI will, General.@0003
Hollace, please see to it that our men
are prepared.@0003@000DAt once, Captain Zoya!@000D@0011@000BSister, this is unlike you.@0003
What has happened?@0003
It is unlike you for you to doubt
yourself or our liege lord.@0003@0009You read me well, dear sister.@0003
Lord Gradin's actions as of late
are... troubling.@0003
However, I remember the debt
that I owe to Lord Gradin.@0003
You may have been too young 
to remember.@0003@000BYes... You've told me before.@0003
Our parents abandoned us,
and we were taken in by Gradin.@0003
and raised in the Castle.@0003
While he did not dote on us
as a father may have,@0003
He presented us with a life
otherwise unattainable..@0003
He saw great potential in us then,
and trained us into soldiers.@0003
I understand that we both
are forever in debt.@0003@0009You are correct, my dear sister.@0003
I apologize for ever wavering.
Please get some rest...@0003
Tomorrow, we will prepare
to end this once and for all.@0003@000BYes. We will end this.@0003
Sister, just one more thing-@0003@0009Hm?@0003
What is it, sister?
You may speak openly with me.@0003@000BLesley I-... never mind.@0003
Forgive me.
I will see you on the morrow.@0003@0009Mhm. Goodnight... Captain Zoya.@0003@0009@0011@000BLord Titus...
Why must you drive this wedge?@0003
# 0x0DB2
@0009@0010@0102@000D@0010@0113@000B@0010@0111
This is the least guarded entrance to the fort. 
Not many would know about this.@0003
@0009I'm amazed we were able 
to get here without much trouble.@0003
@000CThe perks of moving with a small force, 
it is easy to go unnoticed, Storch.@0003
@000DTheir guard is exceptionally light. 
Many soldiers are out collecting prisoners@0003 
They do not expect anyone
to oppose them, especially not here.@0003 
@000BYes, while this is an ideal fort 
against attacks from the west,@0003 
it is particularly weak from the east. 
To be fair, this fort was not designed@0003 
with internal strife in mind.@0003
@0009Makes sense. 
What else do you know about this place?@0003 
You seem to know quite a bit about it.@0003
@000BThere are two entrances that both
lead to the same point.@0003 
It is best we split up so that we don't 
get pincered by the soldiers rushing@0003
 around from the other side.@0003
There may also be many weapons and gold
here unused in prep for war with our@0003
neighbors, we should be able to 
make good use of that if we come@0003 
across the store rooms.@0003
@0009I see... 
Alright, on your ready.@0003
Let's get this over with.@0003
@000BYes. To arms! 
Thunder, heed my call!@0003
Answer me, and smite those
who dare oppose us,@0003
and betray the people of Belaro!@0003
# 0x0DB3
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0111We've claimed the fort. 
A victory is in our hands.@0003
Storch, do you know what this means?@0003
@0009Not exactly, but I presume 
it's a good thing for us.@0003
We have a clean shot at Gradin now.@0003
@000CPrecisely. But we must move soon.@0003
We don't have the numbers to hold out 
here for too long,@0003 
and getting surrounded by Gradin's 
forces would be our undoing.@0003
@0009Right, right.@0003 
@000CLet's prepare for an assault
on Castle Belaro.@0003 
@0009Already?@0003 
I mean, yeah, that sounds 
like a good idea.@0003
@000C... Indeed.@0003 
Everyone get a quick rest, 
we march tomorrow for Castle Belaro.@0003
# 0x0DB4
@0009@0010@0102@000B@0010@0104@000D@0010@0105Storch, you should really get some rest.@0003 
Vagelis is here to relieve your watch duty.@0003
@0009... Right, sorry.@0003
@000BStorch, are you alright?
You don't seem to be yourself lately.@0003
@000DYou're acting weird.@0003
@0009There's a lot to process, you know?@0003 
Lord Titus joining up with us, 
taking on Lord Gradin to liberate Belaro,@0003
the spat with my dad... 
There's a lot to think about.@0003 
Titus seems decent enough, 
but I don't like doing this sort of thing.@0003
I only like fighting if I need to, 
I'm not into this whole@0003
"going on the offensive". 
It's not why we got together.@0003
I mean, I know I said we 
kinda needed to do this,@0003
but that doesn't mean I'm
all gung ho about it.@0003
It's eating away at me,
like a caterpillar on a leaf.@0003
@000DSometimes you need to strike 
before your foe can see you.@0003
@000BVagelis is right.@0003 
Although this has gotten much 
larger than any of us could've@0003 
bargained for. 
We are all a wary about all of this.@0003
@0009Yeah... 
I'm not sure if I should be so trusting.@0003 
He has no army to call his own, 
only a small force of loyal soldiers,@0003
and wants to use us to claim the throne...@0003
Who's to say he will be better 
than Gradin at ruling?@0003 
Will he care for the people?@0003
I don't really know much of his ideals.@0003
@000DHe is a noble. 
He is not used to people like us.@0003 
We are all from the country, 
we simply exist to subsidize their livestyles.@0003
@0009Yeah... 
It's all a bit fishy to me.@0003 
Do you know him at all, Esfir?@0003
@000BKnow him? Personally?@0003 
N-no, not at all.@0003 
Rumor has it that he is more like 
his Uncle than his Father,@0003 
and that is not necessarily a good thing,
despite what he was told us.@0003 
He has some influence in the court 
and is perceived to be intelligent..@0003 
Presumably, he is a threat to Gradin, 
and Titus would be smart enough to see this.@0003 
Perhaps pre-emptively rebelling is a 
way to ensure his own safety,@0003 
else he face the same fate as his father.@0003
@0009Does Gradin not have any children of his own?@0003
@000BNo, he had a wife who died years ago.@0003 
Before they could produce a child, 
she passed away due to illness.@0003 
There are rumors that he has bastard children, 
as many nobles do, but none that are known.@0003
Most Lords would have some insurance, and
if Gradin does, the general public is unaware.@0003
Titus too, lacks an heir should he 
ascend to lead Belaro.@0003
However, Titus is still young and 
could produce an heir if he were@0003
to take the throne soon.
@0009Would there be any way
for such a child to make a claim?@0003
@000BDoubtful.@0003 
There is nothing mythic about his 
line that serves as irrefutable to his claim.@0003 
@0009So anyone could come up
with a claim as this child?@0003 
Pah, what a load of baloney.@0003
@000DIt would not surprise me 
to see someone make such a claim.@0003 
Lusting for power is universal 
weakness in humans.@0003
@000BIndeed. 
Storch, you should really get some rest.@0003
@0009Right, right.@0003 
I'll try to get some shut eye. 
Be safe.@0003
@000DDon't worry about me.@0003
We'll need you to be at 
your best tomorrow.@0003
@0009Right.@0003
@000BThanks, Vagelis. 
Good night.@0003

Is there someone on watch?@0003
@0009Well met, Lord Titus.
Yes, Vagelis is keeping watch.@0003 
What are you doing awake at this hour?@0003
@000CI have struggled to sleep more than
a few hours at a time for years now.@0003 
There is much to think about, 
and my mind does not seem@0003 
to be able to rest. 
Tireless, in multiple senses.@0003 ?
@0009I see.@0003
@000CTell me, Esfir.@0003 
Your daughter, Lera... 
How did she come to use magic?@0003
@0009I met a sage 
seeking an apprentice,@0003 
who thought she had great potential.@0003 
Lera studied with him for years 
in the capitol before we left for Belaro.@0003
@000CMm, I see... 
She is quite talented.@0003 
I'm sure you and her father are proud.@0003
@0009... Yes. I am proud of my daughter.
She has handled herself well in our struggles,@0003
both on and off the battlefield. 
I only hope that this will all end soon.@0003
@000CAs do I, Esfir. As do I.@0003
@0009While it has been... 
most pleasurable, chatting with you,@0003 
Lord Titus, I would like to get a 
few hours of rest before@0003 
we move tomorrow.@0003
@000CNot a problem at all, Esfir.

Storch, per Titus' recommendation, 
goes on the offensive and attacks@0003
Gradin's forces and seize a key fort in 
Belaro's defenses,@0003 
allowing for Storch and co. a clear shot
at the capitol.@0003 
Not wanting to squander the 
opportunity to catch the enemy by surprise,@0003
Storch and team sacrifice a
night of sleep and march@0003 
on towards Gradin's manse.@0003
They arrive at the supply depot,
a poorly guarded part of the Castle town@0003
It is here where a decisive strike
can be made against the enemy...@0003

We are not far from Castle Belaro.@0003 
This is where Gradin keeps
most of the army's supplies.@0003
Weaponry, tomes, food... all here.@0003
@000AIt's huge...@0003
You keep feed a town ten times over, 
just look at all this food!@0003
@0008He is a big man, after all, Storch.@0003

Now then, we will need to 
destroy as much as we can.@0003
@000AWhat a waste!@0003 
You mean to say we can't take it? 
I don't like the sound of that at all.@0003
There are people with no food, 
or no money to buy it,@0003
and you're saying just to burn it?@0003
@000CThis is war, Storch.@0003 
If Gradin maintains these supplies, 
our chances of winning are slim.@0003 
Do you think I want to destroy the supplies?@0003
I am doing this because it puts us
in the best position to defeat Gradin.@0003
To claim victory is our goal, is it not?@0003
@000AThere's gotta be another way...@0003 
@000CStorch, please try to understand...@0003 
This is a reality of war that
you will need to face.@0003 
Do you want to end the harsh taxes
on your family?@0003 
Do you want them to feel 
safe in their home?@0003 
They are far from having any 
peace of mind with Gradin at the helm.@0003 
I will lower the taxes, 
I will ensure the people have good lives.@0003
I wish for a more egalitarian society. 
When I take the throne of Belaro... yes.@0003
@000AYeah... No, you're right.@0003 
Alright, let's go.@0003
@0008...@0003
# 0x0DB8
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0111We've destroyed the supplies...@0003 
let's keep moving before 
any reinforcements arrive.@0003
@0009... Right!@0003
# 0x0DB9
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0102Esfir.@0003
@0009Storch, you've been quiet tonight. 
What's wrong?@0003
@000CI don't want to do this anymore.@0003
@0009What do you mean?@0003
@000CI'm tired of fighting.@0003 
This is exhausting, and I don't feel good 
about what we are doing.@0003
Going on the offensive,@0003 
ransacking supplies that could 
be used by the people...@0003 
It doesn't sit well with me.@0003
@0009Do you realize the implications 
if you were to leave though?@0003 
This is all very sudden, Storch.@0003
@000CI know...@0003 
But I just want things to get back 
to how they were.@0003 
I just want to go home and relax... 
I don't care about any of this!@0003 
I can't believe I stood up to my dad 
and talked such a big game,@0003 
I'm in way over my head! 
I never wanted this!@0003
@0009Storch.@0003 
Do you realize the implications of 
what you are saying?@0003 
We've come too far to abandon this now.@0003 
And if you were to leave, what then? 
You're the face of all this now.@0003 
The townspeople support Titus 
because you do!@0003 
If you were to leave, this rebellion 
would fall apart and we would all@0003 
meet our end sooner than later. 
Lord Gradin would continue his rule.@0003
Is that what you want?@0003
@000C... No. You're right, Esfir.@0003 
I'm sorry... I'm feeling stressed. 
There's just been a lot to think about.@0003 
Everything changed so fast, you know?@0003 
It doesn't feel like that long ago we were
just trying to rip off a few@0003 
rich folks to feed our families...@0003 
Now we're in a full-scale rebellion 
against the Lord of the State himself!@0003 
@0009Things will always change, Storch.@0003 
The impact of those changes are 
largely affected by how you@0003 
choose to handle them.@0003 
Just remember you can get through anything,@0003 
but when people rely on you... 
You have to step up.@0003 
@000CPah, I'm nothing special.@0003
@0009None of that talk.@0003 
Look, you can wallow in self-pity 
and yearn for the days of yore,@0003 
but it isn't going to come back.@0003 
Even when this is all over, 
it won't be the same.@0003 
You can spend your time clamoring 
for the past that you'll never experience@0003 
again, or try and forge a new 
and better future.@0003 
@000C... Yeah. I'm sorry.@0003
@0009It's alright. We're all stressed.@0003 
You're not alone in this. 
Once we defeat Gradin,@0003 
we can go back to our normal lives...
Whatever that will look like now.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003 
We just gotta keep fighting 
through it, I guess.@0003
@0009Right.@0003 
We should get prepared for sleep.@0003 
We are going to march towards the 
castle on the morrow.@0003
@000CYeah, this is going to be
our toughest battle yet.@0003 
I'm just looking forward 
to it all being over...@0003
# 0x0DBA
@0009@0010@FFFF@000B@0010@0119@000D@0010@0118@000DSo you've come...@0003
Peace, we do not wish to fight you.@0003
We are loyal to Lord Titus and his cause.
Let us join you!@0003
# 0x0DBB
@000C@0010@0118@0009@0010@0119Captain Zoya?@0003
Why are we here?@0003
Shouldn't you be at
the war council with General Lesley?@0003
@000CHollace... We are leaving.@0003
@0009W-what? L-leaving?@0003
Does that mean... you intend
to betray Lord Gradin?@0003
@000CYes.@0003
Now Hollace, you don't have
to come with me, but I've@0003
made up my mind already.
I brought you here because@0003
I want you to come with me.@0003
@0009B-but betrayal invites death!
Do you know what they do to traitors?@0003
They murder them!@0003
@000C... I understand your concern.@0003
But I cannot sit idly by and watch
Lord Gradin destroy Belaro.@0003
He has changed, Hollace.@0003
Although he saved my sister and I
from a life of poverty,@0003
his actions are unjust... 
I cannot support him.@0003
My sister has changed too...
She is blind in her loyalty.@0003
She is unable to think
on her own accord,@0003
and if she does, she certainly
does not feel compelled to@0003
act upon her true feelings.@0003
Lord Titus is a just man...
I want to fight for what's right,@0003
even if it means squaring off
against my sister.@0003
@0009Captain...
I've always admired your resolve.@0003
Although I am a soldier of Belaro,
I am first your soldier, Captain.@0003
You've never steered us wrong.@0003
I apologie for my reaction,
it's just... I don't want to die.@0003
I don't want to die a traitor's death.@0003
@000CHollace, no one is going
to murder you.@0003
A traitor's death is only for those
who betray what is right, right?@0003
I'm confident we're on the correct side.@0003
Do not fear.@0003
@0009A-alright.@0003
Captain Zoya... I am with you!@0003
@000CHollace... You're shaking.@0003
For such an imposing figure,
you're quite nervous, aren't you?@0003
@0009It's a feeling that
I-I can't shake in times like this.@0003
I know in my head what's right,
but to betray Lord Gradin?@0003
It is a b-bold move.@0003
But I place my trust in you, Captain.@0003
Any good soldier would.
I apologize for doubting you.@0003
@000CHollace...
Thank you.@0003
I knew I could count on you.
Let's wait here.@0003
Lord Titus will be sure to pass
through the supply depot...@0003
It is the most poorly guarded,
by that blowhard, Commander Gelt.@0003
@0009Yes...
We will not fail.@0003
I am r-ready, Captain Zoya,@0003
even if I don't look it.@0003
# 0x0DBC
@0009@0010@011A@000C@0010@0142@000CCommander Erasmus?@0003
Did General Lesley request
reinforcements?@0003
@0009General Bromhilda, quite the
opposite, I'm afraid.@0003

@000CHm? What do you mean,
Erasmus?@0003
Please, speak your heart with me.@0003
@0009General, I met with Lord Titus at
the supply depot.@0003
I was deployed under Commander
Gelt.@0003
I spoke with Lord Titus.
He is not our enemy.@0003
This is not our fight.@0003
I cannot draw my blade
against a man who has@0003
every justification for 
his actions.@0003
@000CCommander Erasmus... I am
impressed by your courage.@0003
Many soldiers would not
so openly speak with their leader@0003
about their allegiance to the enemy.@0003
Tell me, do you plan to join them?@0003@0009Lord Titus asked me this as
well, and I told him no...@0003
I only told him that I was going to
speak with you.@0003
General, surely you see something
runs afoul here.@0003
Why is Emperor Festan so
interested in these prisoners?@0003
Why does Lord Gradin artifically
raise taxes in order to imprison@0003
normal citizens?@0003
These are questions that bog
my mind, and I want answers.@0003
So no, General Bromhilda. I do 
not intend to join them,@0003
I intend to find the truth.
General, let's leave this place,@0003
and return to the capitol.
We may find more answers there.@0003@000CVery well. Commander Erasmus,
as your superior, I should@0003
chastise you for your actions
here today, but I too share@0003
your reservations. But it is not
our jobs to posture and strut@0003
about as the nobles do.
It is our job to fight.@0003
However, this once, and just this
once, my heart supersedes@0003
my duty. For perhaps if we 
find out the truth, we can@0003
too improve Nevan...@0003
A soldier's duty to protect,
is it not?@0003@0009General Bromhilda...
Thank you.@0003
Let's go.@0003
# 0x0DBD
After taking the supply depot, 
Storch and co. reluctantly@0003 
burn all of the rations@0003
Gradin's forces held there.@0003 
Despite dealing a massive blow 
to their foe's morale,@0003 
Storch feels regret and 
remorse for being so wasteful@0003 
for the sake of their victory.@0003 
With heavy hearts and a 
clear road before them,@0003 
they had to Gradin's manse to@0003 
prepare for what could be 
their final battle...@0003
# 0x0DBE
@0009@0010@0113@000C@0010@0111@000CHelga.@0003
@0009Hm? 
Lord Titus?@0003 
What is it?@0003
@000CA word.
Do you have a moment?@0003
@0009And if I didn't?@0003
@000CHush. 
Are the troops ready?@0003
@0009As ready as they'll be.@0003
It's amazing we've made it this far 
with the support of only@0003 
a few peasants and misfits. 
Even our initial force of soldiers,@0003
proved not to be as valuable
in these battles.@0003
@000CStorch has a natural charisma...@0003
An authentic, relatable personality.@0003
Straightforward goals...@0003
The people are drawn to him. 
Do you think- no, never mind.@0003
@0009Hmph.@0003 
Pardon my tongue, milord, 
but if you're thinking that,@0003 
you'll never be able to
rest easy again.@0003
@000C... Fair.@0003 
Forgive me.@0003
See to it that the preparations
are made.@0003
@0009On it.@0003
# 0x0DBF
@000A@0010@0105@000B@0010@0106This castle... It's huge!@0003
Glad our tax dollars are getting 
put to good use.@0003 
You could fit all the gold in Belaro 
in there and still have room.@0003
@000AThat's to be expected, 
everyone else is broke.@0003
@000BMan... @0003
What would you do if you 
had all that money, though?@0003
@000ARest.@0003 
@000BYou'd probably still eat rabbit
too, you savage.@0003 
@000ATastes better than 
the beaver you'd eat.@0003
@000BVagelis!@0003
@000D@0010@0102
@000BStorch!
How you holding up?@0003
@000DSomehow.@0003 
The plan has been set.@0003
Titus wants us to divide our 
forces and attack from two points.@0003 
I'm going to round up everyone 
and decide who goes where.@0003 
@000BSplitting us up?@0003 
That's crazy talk!@0003 
There's barely enough of us to 
fill a pub,@0003 
much less storm a castle.@0003
@000DAccording to Titus, 
Gradin doesn't have as many men@0003 
as you'd think. Many have deserted
or joined us instead.@0003 
The castle likely won't have 
that many soldiers.@0003
@000AThey need room for all
of our gold after all. Right, cousin?@0003
@000BWhy you--@0003
@000DCome on, 
let's rejoin the others.@0003
@000D@0011@000A@0011@000B@0011@000B@0010@0102@0008@0010@0113@000A@0010@0111So, the plans are set then?@0003
@000BYes, everyone's been informed.@0003
@000AGood.@0003 
I'll take a small force to the 
west side of the castle.@0003 
Storch, you will lead the charge
through the main gate.@0003 
Fear not, the gate is 
not well guarded.@0003 
Attacking from two sides will@0003
ensure we will 
not be overwhelmed.@0003
@000BMakes sense, but tell me,@0003 
Lord Titus, does Gradin expect 
reinforcements at any point?@0003 
Surely not all of the remaining 
soldiers dwell within the castle.@0003
@0008Are you questioning 
Lord Titus' plan, Storch?@0003
@000APeace, Helga.@0003
It is a valid concern. 
Frankly, I am uncertain of@0003 
Gradin's allegiances. 
While I doubt any of Belaro's@0003 
neighbors will come to her aid, 
the imperial troops from@0003 
the capitol may send a token 
force to assist.@0003 
It is not to be concerned with.@0003
@000BAnd why's that?@0003
@000AThe Emperor, Festan,@0003 
is a cold and callous man.@0003 
He cares not for the people... 
He only cares for his coffers@0003
and living a lavish lifestyle. 
His force may as well be@0003
here to collect tax money.@0003 
@000BShould you speak so openly
about the Emperor?@0003 
Frankly, I don't know much about the man.@0003 
I didn't even know much about Gradin
either until recently.@0003 
It's a lot simpler not 
worrying about these things.@0003
@000AThe Emperor has no ears here. 
All is well.@0003
@0008The Emperor wouldn't care, besides.@0003 
This is Belaro. We're nothing to them.
Like any of the states,@0003 
so long as they pay up, 
he doesn't really care@0003 
who sits atop the throne.@0003
@000B... Right. 
I'll go get ready.@0003
@000B@0011@000AThere goes a man
with a lot on his mind...@0003
@0008He can think once this is over.@0003 
He knows he can't back out.@0003 
These countryfolk like to kick
and scream about being@0003 
treated unfairly, 
then once the fighting starts,@0003 
they can't wait for it to end.@0003
@000AWhile I don't fully disagree, 
they've been helpful to us.@0003 
We would not be here without them. 
You must remember, Helga,@0003 
these aren't trained soldiers. 
These are people fighting@0003 
for their lives...@0003 
For the right to live their lives. 
It's a remarkable thing, really.@0003
@0008Yeah, yeah. I hear you.@0003 
I just don't have patience 
for this wishy-washy crap.@0003 
Make a decision, 
and see it through.@0003
@000AIndeed... 
Let's go ready the attack.@0003
@000D@0011@000B@0011@0008@0010@0105@000B@0010@0104@000A@0010@0102Are you all ready?@0003
@000BStorch? 
I haven't heard the plan yet..@0003
Has it changed?@0003
@000AOh, right...@0003
@000B ... Storch.@0003
@0008Esfir, we are splitting 
our forces and attacking@0003 
from two sides to catch 
them off guard.@0003
@000BI see... 
Alright, let's fall in.@0003

Am I wrong? Tell me!@0003

Gather in, we are not done here!@0003

Why are we all gathering
in this room?@0003

Listen. 
Do you hear that?@0003

the challenger.@0003
@0008Uncle... This is lost!@0003 
Do not continue this fight, 
we must avoid senseless bloodshed.@0003
Concede to me!@0003
@000BSenseless?@0003 
That is rich, coming from you. 
You're the one who betrayed me!@0003
You are now trapped inside 
my manse... You can surrender,@0003 
or we can wait for you and@0003 
your little friends to starve as 
we suffocate you from all sides.@0003

something to do about it!@0003

You're the instigator 
behind all of this.@0003 
You've made quite 
the disturbance, but that@0003
will end today.@0003
@000ANo it will not!@0003 
Every single one of your soldiers
we've fought has said something@0003 
just like that.@0003 
"End of your days" this,@0003 
"death" that. @0003
"You will rue the day you crossed
me".@0003 
Phooey to it all!@0003 
There's too much talk.
Just do what needs to get done.@0003

to you! We gotta fight!@0003 
@0008Yes... Storch, 
you are most right.@0003 
We've stuck together this far... 
This trap will be an@0003 
opportunity for us to 
end it ourselves!@0003
@000BDoubtful.@0003
You will both die here.
Blood spilling out of your@0003
bellies as you reach out
for the throne with your@0003
dying gasps! It will be 
out of reach now,@0003
and in the after life!@0003@0008Never!@0003@000APah! What an idiot!@0003

Me?@0003
Don't make me laugh, boy.@0003
Look around you.
You are completely surrounded.@0003
You walked right into this

far for a reason. have we not?@0003
@000CYeah...
Yeah, you're right.@0003
Esfir, my heart is racing...@0003
I'm not scared...@0003
I'm anxious, my hand twitches.@0003
I want to fight! 
I gotta end this!@0003
@0009Good. Storch, I want@0003
you to have this ring.@0003
When I was your age,
I was a thief in the capitol@0003
of Nevan. I stole this from
a merchant. It's value I was@0003
never sure of, but I was
always fond of it.@0003
I was proud of my accomplishment,
I vowed to never sell it.@0003
It was a reminder that I can@0003
accomplish anything I set my 
mind to.@0003
I want you to have this,
to remember the same thing.@0003
@000CAn old ring?@0003
Esfir... Thanks. 
I'll never forget it.@0003
# 0x0DC4
I don't know how to make an 
"escape" command, so you will@0003
need to seize the tile that doesn't 
quite fit at the edge of the map.@0003
Thanks so much for downloading,
hope you have fun.@0003
Please send over any and all
feedback so I can continue to@0003
improve the overall experience.@0003
# 0x0DC5
Seize one of the misfit tiles
near the boss to escape.@0003
General Lesley is following
close behind, and more soldiers@0003
will appear at the start of the 
map in the meantime.@0003
Good luck!@0003

@000C@0010@0111@0009@0010@0102Lord Titus!@0003
What's the plan?@0003
@000CWe don't have much
choice, we must hold out,@0003
and then push!@0003
Push out to defeat Lord Gradin,
once and for all.@0003
This will be the decisive battle.@0003
Storch, are you ready?@0003
@0009Heck, as ready as
I'll be, I suppose.@0003
@000CRight.
Shall we?@0003
@0009Let's go!@0003

@000CIt is over, dear uncle.@0003

Concede Belaro to me,
and I shall spare your life!@0003
@0009Pah...
Concede to you?@0003

@0008@0080@000A@0008You bastard!
Let him go!@0003@000DYou think hurling
insults at me is going@0003
to set your dear Titus free?@0003
No!@0003
If I am going to die here,
so will the rest of the royal line!@0003
@000CI'm... I can't...
breathe... Storch!@0003
@000DYes... I'll choke
the blasted life out of you!@0003
@0008No! Stop!@0003
@000DOne false move, boy,
and Titus dies!@0003
I'll let him go, but you
must all agree to lay down@0003
your arms. You will walk away,
and I will let you all leave.@0003
@0008How can we trust you!?
If we're disarmed, who's to say@0003
that you won't stab us in the back?@0003
@000CStorch... Don't...@0003
It's... a... trap!@0003
Ack!@0003
@000DQuiet!@0003
Is it a deal, Storch?@0003
@0008Lord Titus...@0003
Blast it all!@0003
@000DThe choice is clear,
is it not?@0003
Ha ha!
This is the fate to those@0003
who dare to cross me!@0003
@0009@0010@0104Storch, behind you!@0003
@0008Huh?@0003
@000DUrk! What?@0003
But who? 
Gaaaaah....@0003
@000D@0011@000CCough... I'm free...@0003
@0008Dad?!@0003
@000D@0010@015AWell met, Storch.@0003
Seems you still need
your old man after all, eh?@0003
@0008Dad?! How did you...
I mean...@0003
I'm confused.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@0109Dad!@0003
@000DMarlen...@0003
I'm glad to see you're well.
Owen is here too.@0003
@0009@0011@0009@0010@012DStorch, you did well boy.@0003
@000C@0011@000B@0010@010AFather!
You came!@0003
@0009Yes. We heard you
were fighting in Castle Belaro,@0003
and we couldn't bear to sit idly.@0003
I grabbed my axe, and we head 
over as quickly as we could.@0003
Ol' Pawel over here beat me
to it, he's still quite the rider.@0003
@000DI could not wait
any longer for my boys to come home.@0003
I know it isn't much, but I wanted
to lend you our strengh.@0003
@0008Dad, you realize
that you saved us?@0003
That's Lord Gradin
that you impaled.@0003
@000DI'm just doing what
needs to be done, right son?@0003
@0008Yeah...
So that's it...@0003
We did it.@0003
It's all over... finally.@0003
# 0x0DC9
And so ends the rebellion
against Lord Gradin.@0003
Saved in the nick of time
by Storch's dad, Gradin was slain.@0003
Lord Titus vowed to rebuild Belaro,
and tapped Storch to help him@0003
in his efforts.@0003
While Storch wished to return home,
his companions all agreed to@0003
stay on and help Lord Titus.@0003
The tax policy was lowered
and the prisoners were freed.@0003
In time, joy returned to the land
as the citizens of Belaro felt@0003
coin in their pocket for the first
time in a long while.@0003
For this, they grew to love 
Lord Titus, and were moved@0003
by his tale.@0003
Storch too became something
of a celebrity, and a symbol@0003
of hope for the people,
for they now knew that through@0003
action, they too could achieve
their goals.@0003
However, despite this, there
were still unanswered questions.@0003
What was the reason for 
Gradin's actions?@0003
Why did the Emperor seek
out the prisoners?@0003
These questions weighed heavily
on the mind of Lord Titus,@0003
but he cast this aside to focus on 
his duties as the new Lord of 
the State.@0003
It is three months later where
we pick up our story...@0003
# 0x0DCA
@000C@0010@0111@0009@0010@0102Lord Titus,
what news do you bring?@0003
It's not like you to send
a messenger after me.@0003
@000CWell met, Storch.
Yes, there is news.@0003
We have much to discuss.
Please gather everyone.@0003
Excuse me.@0003
@000C@0011
@0009Alright...@0003
Dang, I wonder what it could
be...@0003
No sense in wasting time
worrying.@0003
Can't be any worse than @0003
what we've gone through
already...@0003

Only someone with
intimate knowledge of@0003
Belaro's defenses could've
pierced them so easily.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0111@000CMy sincere apologies, Garrison.@0003 
I did not intend for us to become enemies.
You have always been a fine soldier.@0003
It isn't too late, I will welcome you
into our ranks, and upon@0003
Gradin's removal from the throne,
I will give you a better post@0003
thank this measly fortress!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0137@0009Talk is cheap, Lord Titus.@0003
You have betrayed Gradin 
and forsaken your name.@0003
I care not for the accoutrements
of rich nobles.@0003
This fort and a sense of duty
are all I need.@0003 
And it's my duty to make sure
that no one takes it!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0111@000CYou're an honorable

why do you fight your brethren?@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0111@000CIt is not I who am a traitor,@0003
but it is your loyalty to Gradin 
that blinds you from the truth.@0003 
Alas!@0003 
He betrays the people, 
and thus I will prevail and@0003 
take the throne for myself!@0003
# 0x0DDA
@0009@0010@0138You there!@0003

You're from the capitol!@0003
Why are you fighting
in this rebellion?@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0116@000CHm?@0003
Sorry, I can't say
I remember who you are.@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0138@0009Pah!@0003
I studied at the finest 
academy in Nevan.@0003
During our military
tactics course,@0003
I was assigned to shadow
a "real" soldier,@0003
to better understand
the men I'd command.@0003
You however, were
far from exemplary.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0116@000COh yeah...
Now I remember that.@0003
They had me do that a 
few times.@0003
I would always take
the students to my@0003
favorite pub...
Good times.@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0138@0009You realize,@0003
in your idiocy,
what that cost me?@0003
I didn't learn the requisite
info for my exam,@0003
and lost my chance to
become a Lieutenant!@0003
They sent me out to 
this backwater state@0003
instead. No matter.@0003
I won't let you stop me
a second time!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0116@000CHa...
I always hated doing shadowing.@0003
I'm glad it paid off for me
this time at least.@0003

@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009Regardless of the odds,
Lord Titus,@0003
I know something about
the importance of loyalty.@0003
As General of this State,
I cannot back down from@0003
any threat, both external
and internal!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0111@000CI know Lord Gradin
has treated you and@0003
your sister kindly...
But please, you don't need@0003
to throw all of that away!
It is a fool's errand!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009I'd rather die a 
loyal fool, then.@0003
Than live as a traitorous pig!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0111@000C... I see there is 
nothing else I can say.@0003

at the war council,
I knew you had left us.@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0118@000CBut sister!@0003
Don't you see this is wrong?

Lord Gradin is using you?@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009Sister,@0003
have you forgotten our past?
It was Lord Gradin, and@0003
his sacrifice that allows us
to stand where we are today.@0003
Who am I to cast aside
the hand that has fed us@0003
for our lives?@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0118@000CLord Gradin was kind
to us, that is true, Lesley.@0003
We were small children,
our parents... gone.@0003
He took us to the castle
and provided us with@0003
the care and education
on the condition that we@0003
joined the army...@0003
This is not lost on me.
But he has changed.@0003
Something is not right,
clearly you see it, sister!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009The only thing wrong,
dear sister, is that I must@0003
face you in this fight.@0003
While you are my family,
I am loyal to Belaro, first!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0118@000CLesley, no!@0003
Why must you do this?!@0003

@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009Speak no further!@0003 
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000CYou still hold a grudge,
from all those years ago?@0003
Even though you are General now,
or should I say, were General,@0003
you still resent me.@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@014C@0009I suppose I do...
I'll take extra pleasure in this!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0113@000CThe feeling's mutual!@0003
# 0x0DDF
@000C@0010@0102@0009@0010@0139So you've made it this
far, have you? No matter,@0003
I'll end your little rebellion
myself.@0003
@000CGradin...@0003
You've caused me and my
friends a whole lot of heartache.@0003
I didn't even know who you were
until a couple of months ago,@0003
and come to think of it,
you'd probably be better off@0003
right now if I didn't.@0003
Tell me though, why did
you raise the taxes to be@0003
so damn high?@0003
None of the people could
afford much of anything!@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0139@0009The taxes are no concern to
you.@0003
All that matters is that the
Emperor is satisfied.@0003
If he does not receive
the prisoners...@0003
Belaro would...
Pah,@0003
The Lord need not explain
himself to the common man!@0003@0009@0011@000C@0010@0102@000CWhat the heck
does he want prisoners for?@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0139@0009I cannot say, boy.@0003
That isn't for you to know.
I cannot say why I am@0003
complicit in this.
And if I were to tell you,@0003
you'd take it to the grave.
Now then, draw your blade!@0003

you have no right!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0104@000CYou're quite tough,
Lord Gradin.@0003
Much tougher than the man I
remember, crying in my@0003
lap, lamenting how he
would never produce an heir.@0003
And I haven't even gotten
to the part where@0003
he felt self-conscious about his-@0003
@000C@0011@0009@0010@0139@0009Stop it!
Stop it this instant!@0003
I will not let this stand!@0003
@0009@0011@000C@0010@0104@000CYou deserve this,
for treating me and those@0003
other women so poorly!@0003
And the mewling to us

you sealed for yourself!@0003

@000CUncle...
Tell me the truth.@0003
It was not an accident
that killed my father.@0003
It was by your hand,
wasn't it? Tell me!@0003
@0009Vespasian had to go.@0003
He was opposed to what
I was doing.@0003
I did not expect for his son
to get in my way, however.@0003
@000CSo you killed your 
own brother... But why?!@0003
You're a despicable man!
Your own brother!@0003
@0009Pah,
he would've offed me too@0003
had he had the chance,
the conniving snake.@0003
He had to go.@0003
@000CUncle...
You really have changed.@0003
This is not the same
Gradin I remember.@0003
Has your lusting for power
left you so blind?@0003
Do you not know why
the people rebel?@0003
@0009Silence!@0003
I will not be lectured
by a corpse!@0003

@0009@0010@0109Alright, think I'm all ready...@0003
Hey!@0003
Natsuko!@0003
@000C@0010@0108@000CHey there, Marlen.@0003
Everything alright?
You sure look right as rain.@0003@0009I sure am!
But I got a question for you,@0003
if you don't mind me
asking for a favor.@0003@000CSure, how can I help?@0003@0009How long does it take a
messenger like yourself@0003
to travel back and forth 
to Rask?@0003
You see, I wrote this letter
for my parents,@0003
and I want to make sure they 
get it before we get into@0003
our next fight.@0003
Do you think you could
deliver it for me?@0003@000CRask? At top speed,@0003
I bet I could go back
and forth in less than a day.@0003
Belaro's got a lot of mountains
and forests, which doesn't@0003
bother me much when I'm flying
through the sky.@0003
Do you have the letter?@0003@0009You really mean it?@0003
Thanks Natsuko!@0003
Here it is,
sealed and all!@0003@000B@0080@000C@000CGot it.@0003
Tell the others I'm 
runing this errand,@0003
I'll be back before
you know it!@0003@0009Aw heck, Natsuko.@0003
You're the best!
Be safe now, you hear?@0003
# 0x0DEA
Dear Mom & Dad,
Hey there! It's me, Marlen.@0003
How are you?@0003
I know you can't ask me
cause this is a letter and all,@0003
but I'm doing alright.@0003
I want to let you know that 
our fight is going pretty well,@0003
at least as well as it could
go, I bet.@0003
We just took a fort and
their supply depot,@0003
Lord Titus says that that
puts us in a darn good@0003
position to strike Castle Belaro!@0003
We're gonna fight 'em head
on tomorrow, I'm sure of it.@0003
I know you're all worried about
me and Storch, but heck,@0003
we'll be back home in no time!@0003
Storch is doing pretty well,
he's a little quiet and moody,@0003
but you know he can get 
like that sometimes.@0003
We're alll getting worn out
from all this dang fighting.@0003
Seeing all this death,
heck, it don't sit with me@0003
well at all. I've seen enough
of it to last me my lifetime.@0003
Besides the fighting,
traveling around has been pretty@0003
fun!@0003
I think when this is all over,
and I've gotten some rest,@0003
maybe I'd consider traveling
around some more, see the@0003
world and all that. I've met@0003
a bunch of different kinda of 
people on this quest.@0003
There's folks from Kuching,
Mahala and other parts@0003
of Nevan!@0003 
Even a few of Gradin's 
soldiers came to fight with us.@0003
It's real nice of them to
want to help us like that.@0003
Either way, I just wanted to 
let you know that I'm doing@0003
okay, that Storch is okay too,
and that I love you both@0003
and think of you all the time.
Even Sedgar has this look@0003
in his eyes, like he longs for 
home and towing the fields.@0003
Anyway, I've been rambling
for a bit too long.@0003
Next time you see me,
we'll be heroes!@0003
With Storch and Lord Titus,
I bet we'll never lose!@0003
Love,
Marlen.@0003

my dear Storchinski.@0003
Tee hee.@0003
@000CY-You know I don't
like my full name.@0003 
I'm just Storch!@0003
@0009I'm just pulling your leg, Storch.@0003 
Relax.@0003 
I promise that it'll be 
worth the trip.@0003 
Would a girl like me ever 
steer you wrongly?@0003
@000COkay, I trust you.@0003 
Wait!@0003
My brother is heading south today,
back to port.@0003
I want to make sure I see
him before he heads off.@0003
@0009I'm sure Augustyn won't 
leave without saying goodbye, Storch.@0003 
I hope I get to see his Mahalan 
girlfriend too,@0003 
they're such a
picturesque couple!@0003

Are you heading back
to the border?@0003
@000BYeah, it was great to be back,
but duty calls.@0003 
The border won't guard itself,
you know?@0003 
Besides, Naia's getting homesick.@0003
@000DAs much as I liked 
your swordfighting lessons with Storch,@0003 
I prefer the quiet life
at home with you.@0003
@000BI'm sure everything will be fine,@0003
just like it always is,
right brother?@0003
@000ARight!@0003
@000BSo anyway,@0003 
what are you two lovebirds 
up to today?@0003

help you with that.@0003

head out for a bit to check out@0003 
this cool place she found.@0003
@000BOh yeah? 
Where's that?@0003
@0008It's a secret!@0003 
I want Storch to see it with 
fresh eyes, it's so beautiful!@0003 
@000BI think I know where you're 
talking about... heh,@0003 
brother you're in for
a good time!@0003 
You two should head off 
so you can get back before@0003 
it's too dark. Naia and I are 
leaving by night,@0003 
so we'll see you 
before you get back.@0003
@000AGreat, I want to see you off. 
I'm sure Marlen does too.@0003
@000BSurprised the little guy's not 
sick of me yet,@0003
he's been clinging to my leg
around the clock!@0003
@000DHe's an adorable child.@0003
Augustyn, we should head back 
to your parents.@0003 
I'm sure your mother would 
appreciate your help in the kitchen.@0003
@000BShe'd be wrong not to, ha! 
I can make a mean stew.@0003 
Let's head back.

@000CYeah... 
That'd be nice.@0003 
@0009Storch, what do you want to
do when you grow up?@0003 
Do you ever think about it much?@0003
@000CI want to stay here and help my 
dad with the family farm.@0003 
I'm not much of a fighter
like Augustyn,@0003
and I'd hate to see Marlen 
grow up without either of@0003 
us around. Yeah...@0003 
The simple life sounds nice
for a guy like me.@0003 
Are you gonna take over 
your father's shop?@0003 
Hasn't he taught
you a few things?@0003
@0009Yeah, my father wants to pass 
the shop over to me when he's@0003 
ready to retire.@0003 
He's teaching me all about 
commerce and being a smithy.@0003 
How to identify good iron, steel,
stuff like that.@0003 
He says people will try to rip me
off because I'm a woman,@0003

eh Vagelis?@0003 
@000CIf those are your options,@0003
"stooping to this level"
isn't as bad as you think.@0003
@0009Fair enough.@0003
# 0x0DF4
@0009@0010@0106@000C@0010@0105Tell me, cousin, 
how are your parents?@0003
@0009The old man's the same,@0003
but my old lady's starting to 
real grate me.@0003 
I work my ass of cutting wood 
and trying to make some gold@0003
for them, but it's never enough.@0003
@000CThat is unfortunate. 
Your mother is a lovely woman,@0003 
it pains me to hear she is stressed.@0003
@0009Yeah, crazy as it sounds, 
getting out of town for a few days@0003 
was just what I needed. 
Even if it is to do... this.@0003
@000CI know this weighs heavy 
on your heart, cousin.@0003 
Try not to let it bother you so much.@0003
@0009If only I could be as stone-faced as you.@0003
You'll be mistaken for a statue@0003
with that attitude. Woodcutting is good, 
honest work, but it doesn't pay.@0003 
At least not with the
taxes that are put on us.@0003
@000CThink of this as the rich paying
their share of the tax then.@0003 
They can afford it at least.@0003
@0009Pah. The rich collect taxes 
and they're made into Lords,@0003 
while the poor collect taxes 
and they're labeled thieves.@0003 
It's a cruel world, cousin!@0003
@000CJust be glad you 
have this opportunity...@0003 
Not everyone gets that chance.@0003
@0009...@0003
# 0x0DF5
@000C@0010@0107@0009@0010@0104Lera, don't fall behind. 
We can't afford to move slowly.@0003
@000CI'm... here. 
Whew...@0003 
All of this running is exhausting.@0003
@0009Are you okay, dear? 
Please tell me.@0003
@000CI'm fine, mom.@0003 
Really... 
Please don't worry, I'll stay near.@0003 
@0009Are you certain?@0003
@000CYes! Mom! Heck!@0003 
I'm not a kid anymore.@0003 
You've gotta let me fend for myself!
I'll be F-I-N-E.@0003 
You let me visit the teacher for
months at a time without being around,@0003 
what's so different if 
I'm a few leagues behind you?@0003
@0009This is a battlefield.@0003
I can't ensure your safety 
if you don't stay close.@0003
@000CI can ensure my own safety. 
With my tome,@0003 
none of these guards scare me! 
Watch me go!@0003
@0009Lera, wait!@0003
# 0x0DF6
@0009@0010@0104@000C@0010@0105Esfir.@0003
@0009Vagelis?@0003 
It's not like you to initiate
a conversation.@0003 
Are you okay? 
Did a brigand knock you in the head?@0003
@000CI'm fine. 
It is Storch I am worried about.@0003
@0009Yes, he does seem a 
bit distant lately.@0003 
@000CHe yearns for the peaceful times of yore, 
he tells me.@0003 
This lifestyle is wearing him out.@0003
@0009I've gleaned the same thing. 
If we don't do this though,@0003 
we're all going to get thrown in jail.@0003
And it's not like we have the 
numbers or skills to challenge@0003 
Lord Gradin to make him 
lower the tax rates.@0003 
We're going to have to do 
this for a while unless@0003 
we can find a way to leave Belaro.@0003
@000CI don't disagree.@0003 
This is why I worry about him. 
He hasn't accepted reality yet.@0003
@0009Sometimes, Vagelis, 
people never accept reality.@0003 
People will spend their whole
lives trying to recreate a fleeting@0003 
feeling that they had in their youth, 
looking backwards instead@0003 
of forwards towards what
they could do next...@0003
@000CIndeed.@0003 
Let us hope that Storch 
can adopt this mentality.@0003
@0009You're a good friend, Vagelis.@0003 
Storch needs you now
more than ever.@0003
@000CAnd you.@0003 
Ever since you and Lera arrived,@0003
he has wanted to 
ensure your safety too.@0003
@0009His family helped us quite a
bit when we came here...@0003 
I owe it to him.@0003
@000CThen let's pay back 
that favor, let's go.@0003
@0009Right!@0003
# 0x0DF7
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0104Lera, how are you faring?@0003
@0009Huff... 
puff...@0003 
I'm...
okay.@0003 
We're... 
just moving...@0003 
so fast.@0003
@000C... I know dear.@0003 
Come on, you have to keep pressing.@0003
@0009I... won't let you down!@0003
# 0x0DF8
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0106Vagelis!@0003
You never finished that 
thought the other night.@0003 
About Storch's older brother.
And about Larisa!@0003 
What was with your sharp tongue?@0003
@0009This isn't tea time with 
Great Aunt Deloris, cousin.@0003 
This is an escape attempt. 
We can discuss later.@0003 
Keep moving.@0003
@000CRight, right!@0003
# 0x0DF9
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0109Quick, brother!@0003
Hop on Sedgar! 
We'll be faster.@0003
@0009I cannot leave the others behind, 
besides, you won't be as agile@0003 
if there's a second rider
with you on Sedgar.@0003
@000CAw, fiddlesticks.@0003 
Here I am, 
trying to be helpful and all.@0003 
@0009Trust me, you have a horse.@0003 
You are incredibly helpful, brother. 
I'm sure we will all call on you@0003 
to bail us out more often
than you're even ready for!@0003
@000CThanks, brother. 
Let's keep moving!@0003
# 0x0DFA
@0009@0010@010E@000C@0010@010CI thought by joining up with ya,@0003 
that'd be the end of the state
coming after me.@0003 
What is this racket?@0003
@0009It appears the group 
that saved us has caused@0003 
issue elsewhere. 
We should remain cautious.@0003
@000CArr, we're all just brigands
by a different name,@0003 
it would seem.@0003
# 0x0DFB
An uncommon gemstone
worth 2,500 gold.
# 0x0DFC
@0009@0010@0105@000C@0010@0102Did you really have to shoot him 
before he could finish talking?@0003
@0009He's the enemy.@0003
He wouldn't blink twice to 
do the same to either of us.@0003
@000CYeah, but...@0003
@0009The cheetah doesn't flinch 
when she sinks her fangs@0003
into the gazelle.@0003
We should think like cheetah,@0003
or else we will end up like gazelle.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003 
You have a point. Still...@0003
# 0x0DFD
@0009@0010@0107@000C@0010@0109Lera, don't get too far,@0003
we don't know who,
or what,@0003
we're fighting here!@0003
@0009The air feels funny here.@0003 
Not sure if it's the scent of 
death mixed with an ocean breeze@0003
or what, but it's certainly off.@0003
@000CYeah...@0003 
I feel uneasy being here too. 
Do you sense anything magical?@0003
@0009It doesn't really work like that,
according to my teacher at least.@0003
@000CWhat about other 
kinds of magic?@0003
@0009Maybe, who knows?@0003
All I know is that this fog stinks
and whoever thought fog was@0003
a good idea should 
go soil themselves.@0003
@000CI mean, the fog ain't...@0003
Okay, yeah, it's pretty bad.@0003
# 0x0DFE
@000C@0010@0105@0009@0010@0102Vagelis, how's your shot in the fog?@0003
@000CSame as normal.@0003
@0009So still shit?@0003
@000CHeh, we both know we
wouldn't have made it this far@0003 
if that wasn't the case.@0003
@0009Fair enough.@0003
@000CI've spent many early mornings 
waiting for the fog to fade@0003 
when out on a hunt.@0003 
You can't shoot as far,@0003 
but you can shoot just as 
well at short range.@0003
@0009So for you, still shit?@0003
@000CHeh, would you like 
to participate in target practice?@0003
@0009Ha, I'll pass, 
but thanks for the offer.@0003
# 0x0DFF

Who's trying to shoot
me from behind?@0003
@0009@0010@0110@0009Damn it, missed.@0003 @000CHey man,@0003
watch where you're aiming
that thing.@0003 
You almost hit me.@0003
@0009Is this guy for real? 
In case you haven't noticed,@0003 
we are enemies, pal.@0003 
I'm supposed to shoot at you.@0003
@000CI talked to Storch,@0003 
I'm fighting with you now.@0003 
Why else do you think I'd drift 
so close to your line@0003 
and turn my back?@0003
@0009What? 
Now you're insulting my intelligence?@0003 
Just whose side are you on, anyway?@0003

@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@010EIt is lovely to have you here, Dewi.@0003 
Having an additional staff user 
in our ranks is most helpful.@0003 
I dare say we are blessed to 
have another healer,@0003 
although I must say sometimes 
I do fear becoming irrelevant.@0003
@0009Nonsense!@0003 
We're all amateurs here, 
and we don't really know@0003 
what we're up against. 
Best to play it safe.@0003
@000CIndeed.@0003
Dewi, tell me, I haven't had a 
chance to ask,@0003 
but do you follow in the light?@0003
@0009Religion isn't really my thing,
Onisim. If it helps you do@0003 
and feel good, then who am I
to stop you?@0003 
But all that praying to things that
you can't even see,@0003 
heck if I'd ever do that again.@0003
@000C... I understand.@0003 
I apologize if that came off
as too forward.@0003 
I only ask because I never met
a staff user who didn't.@0003 
Usually stronger mages learn 
to wield them after mastering@0003 
other magics,@0003 
while those who only use 
staves are using it for holy purposes.@0003
@0009Look, I don't really want to 
talk about it.@0003 
We better split up to cover 
the most ground, see ya!@0003
@0009@0011@000CHm, that was abrupt@0003
Priest or pirate,@0003
it appears some people 
run off all the same.@0003
# 0x0F01
@000C@0010@0109@0009@0010@0107Marlen...@0003
Do you ever think about 
what it's going to be like@0003
when this is all over?@0003 
@000CNot too much.@0003 
I always thought things 
would just go back to how@0003
they were. 
You know,@0003 
picking out vegetables that 
look good@0003
and getting apples off of 
trees with your wind magic.@0003 
You know, that sort of thing. 
Why do you ask?@0003
@0009I just don't think it'll be 
all that simple, Marlen.@0003 
Heck, don't you feel like
you've changed,@0003 
traveling and fighting like this?@0003
@000CI guess so...@0003 
I never really thought 
about it, heck, I haven't @0003
had a whole lot of
time to reflect at all@0003
since we got into all this.@0003
@0009Hey Marlen. 
Can you promise me something?@0003
@000CSure, Lera. 
What is it?@0003
@0009Promise me after this 
is all over,@0003 
we'll travel around together.@0003 
We'll go around helping people,@0003
people just like us before
this all started.@0003
@000CLike an adventure?@0003 
Gee, that sure sounds grand, Lera.@0003 
I wonder if Storch would
want to come too.@0003
@0009We'll see... @0003
Anyway, let's talk about 
that later.@0003 
For now, we must fight.@0003
@000CRight!@0003
# 0x0F02
@0009@0010@010F@000C@0010@0110Dewi, what do you 
make of all this?@0003
@0009Make of all what? 
I need context, brother.@0003
@000CPah!
Always the semantics with you.@0003
Look, don't you think this is 
all a little strange?@0003 
I mean, this is Lord Gradin's 
manse!@0003 
This is not all that well guarded.@0003
@0009Do you think something 
is amiss, dear brother?@0003 
Why, it's so unlike you to 
be observant.@0003 
Look at how competent you 
are when you don't drink.@0003
@000CStow it! 
But you agree, don't you?@0003
@0009Yeah, it's definitely odd.@0003 
Lord Titus said most of Gradin's 
forces have deserted,@0003 
or so the rumors go.@0003
@000CI wonder...@0003 
Just be careful, alright? 
I've come too far to lose you.@0003
@0009Oh brother...@0003 
Yes, neither of us will die today. 
I'll make sure of it!@0003
# 0x0F03
@0009@0010@0102@000C@0010@0111Storch.@0003
@0009Lord Titus?
What is it?@0003
@000CI apologize for falling
into this trap.@0003
I was overzealous,@0003
and should've examined 
my sources with a more@0003
critical eye.@0003
@0009Don't sweat it.
We all make mistakes.@0003
I guess we just gotta
fight to get out of this jam.@0003
Am I right?@0003
@000CAh. Yes.@0003
Of course.@0003
@0009I can sit here 
and throw a fit and say@0003
"That Lord Titus is a danged
fool! He lead us to our deaths!"@0003
Or I can work to get out
of the situation.@0003
Ain't gonna do me much 
good making you feel@0003
worse about it.@0003
@000CYes...
Perhaps it isn't a failure,@0003
but merely an opportunity
to do try again and succeed.@0003
@0009That's one way to
look at it.@0003
But stay vigiliant, milord!@0003
We're not out of the 
woods yet.@0003
@000CIndeed. 
Thank you, Storch.@0003
